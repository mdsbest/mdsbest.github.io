        <p>You want to create an online course, but you&#39;re not sure which platform you should be using.</p>
<p>Both <a href="https://serp.ly/kajabi/">Kajabi</a> and <a href="https://serp.ly/teachable/">Teachable</a> are excellent options for online course platforms, but which one is better for you?</p>
<p>That&#39;s what we&#39;re going to figure out.</p>
<p>Both these platforms have their pros and cons when it comes to online course creation. Let&#39;s take a closer look at what makes each of them stand out before we determine a winner.</p>

<h2>Kajabi vs.Teachable - What are the Main Differences?</h2>
<p>There are a lot of differences between Kajabi and Teachable. For example:</p>
<ul>

<li>Kajabi has limits as far as how many online courses you can create and sell. Teachable doesn&#39;t; even on the free plan, you can create and sell unlimited online courses.</li>
<li>Kajabi is more of an all-in-one tool that you can use to create and sell online courses. Teachable primarily focuses on course creation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What are the Benefits of Kajabi?</h3>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg"></p>
<h2>Teachable Online Course Platform - In Depth</h2>
<p><a href="https://serp.ly/teachable/">Teachable</a> is an insanely popular online course platform - it has more than 83,000 instructors and over 23 million students, worldwide.</p>

<p>Their landing page is very visual and engaging, which can help your students get more interested in learning.</p>
<p>And once your students are ready to begin your online course, they&#39;ll love how simple the layout is.</p>
<h3>What are the Benefits of Teachable?</h3>

<h3>What are the Downsides to Using Teachable?</h3>
<p>There are a few things about Teachable that we aren&#39;t too fond of.</p>
<p>Some of their marketing features leave a little to be desired. For example, they don&#39;t have integrated email marketing.</p>
<p>But, their platform integrates well with other apps, websites, and third-party tools, so you can seamlessly connect your own email marketing software.</p>
<p>You&#39;re also going to encounter some fees - even on the free plan and basic plan. We recommend that you just factor these costs into the prices of your courses.</p>

<h2>Kajabi vs.Teachable: Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>Now that you have the basic information you need, let&#39;s answer some of the burning questions you might have about choosing Teachable vs.Kajabi.</p>
<h3>What Should You Consider Before Deciding Between Kajabi and Teachable?</h3>
<p>There are several key points you will want to consider when you&#39;re trying to decide on an online course creator:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How many students will you be teaching?</strong> This is important for you to know. Like we mentioned above, you can have a different amount of students with Kajabi, based on the type of plan you choose. But with Teachable, you can have unlimited courses and students, which is really nice.</li>
<li><strong>What email provider do you plan to use?</strong> In our opinion, one of Kajabi&#39;s best marketing features is its email services. They have their own email platform that you can take advantage of, but it also integrates with many others (MailChimp, Drip, etc.). With Teachable, they use a service called Zapier that integrates with your chosen email service provider.</li>
<li><strong>What payment processor do you use?</strong> Kajabi has limited options (Stripe and PayPal only), whereas Teachable has many (Stripe, PayPal, Mastercard, Visa, and American Express). So if you want more options, Teachable might be the way go to.</li>
<li><strong>Do you have mobile students?</strong> Kajabi doesn&#39;t have an app, so your students will be stuck at their computers as they learn. Teachable offers an app for iPhone users, which is really nice.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Are There Limits for Courses and Student Enrollments?</h3>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Basically, Teachable allows you to have unlimited courses and student enrollments.</p>
<p>Not the case with Kajabi.</p>
<p>As your online business grows, you will probably have to upgrade your plan in order to keep providing your services to your students.</p>
<h2>Can You Build Your Own Pipelines or Sales Pages?</h2>
<p>This is one of the things we really like about Kajabi vs.Teachable. There really is no beating its marketing tools.</p>
<p>You can build one awesome sales page (or more, if you choose).</p>
<p>Teachable is really lacking in this area, but it&#39;s excellent in other areas, so it really depends on what your individual needs are as you sell courses.</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line: Which is Best for Selling Online Courses - Kajabi or Teachable?</h2>
<p>We can see some pros and cons with both Kajabi and Teachable.</p>
<p>But in all honesty, we have to admit that Teachable wins the match for the best online course platform.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s why.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pricing</strong> - We love that Teachable has a free plan, which helps you get started right away if you don&#39;t have a lot of money to spend on your online business currently. Plus, the paid plans are still about three times more affordable than Kajabi.</li>
<li><strong>Course compliance</strong> - You can enforce a lot of things with this platform, like the order of your lectures, videos, and quiz completion.</li>
<li><strong>Certifications</strong> - We don&#39;t care who you are, when you finish something, it feels good to have that certification of completion in your hands. With Kajabi, you could always make your own, but we like that Teachable has that built right into its platform.</li>
<li><strong>Unlimited courses</strong> - Let&#39;s face it; unlimited anything is really good. You never know when a stroke of genius is going to hit you and you&#39;re going to want to create a new course. With Teachable, you can. With Kajabi, you can&#39;t.</li>
<li><strong>App availability</strong> - Everybody and their grandma is mobile now, so having an app so your students can learn on the go is a really big plus in our opinion.</li>
<li><strong>Time</strong> - Even though Kajabi is a great way to start your online business because of its sales pages and other stellar features, we like that Teachable takes a lot less time to set up. It&#39;s definitely the better option for entrepreneurs who want to sell online courses quickly.</li>
