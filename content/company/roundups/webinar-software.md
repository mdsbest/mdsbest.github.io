### [#2 Demio](https://serp.ly/demio/)

**[Demio](https://serp.ly/demio/)** is one of the fastest-growing webinar platforms available - and for good reason. It comes with a lot of cool features that aren’t available on many other softwares. 

One of the biggest selling points is the ability to do automated or live webinars. Many webinar platforms only offer one or the other, which means you would be paying for two different webinar options instead of just this one. 

**[Demio](https://serp.ly/demio/)** also has interactive polls you can do with viewers, offers with call-to-action bars in the sidebar, sharing documents and running Q&As. 

But these two things aren’t as important as this last factor which should be one of the primary selling points for webinar software. 

The interface.

### [#3 EverWebinar](https://serp.ly/ever-webinar/)

**[EverWebinar](https://serp.ly/ever-webinar/)** was one of the first companies to ever think about an evergreen or automated webinar. They are one of the best if you plan on scheduling and automating your webinars to play at any time you want and seem like it's a live experience for viewers. 

**The same company creates EverWebinar and WebinarJam**.

Most people create a live webinar using WebinarJam and then use EverWebinar to turn it into an automated one that gets used repeatedly. 

With EverWebinar, their entire interface makes it seem like it’s an actual live webinar. They have special automation tools like replaying every hour or blocking specific times like nights or holidays. 

One of their best and most used features is their Just-In-Time webinars. This feature tells your customers and audience that there is a webinar starting within a few minutes, and they can join right now to get in. 

Imagine a reader or potential prospect finds your site and has a problem. The moment where they’ll turn into a buyer is never bigger than right at that moment. Then your webinar comes up with their solution right then. 

#### **Pros**

- Ability to integrate and switch between WebinarJam and EverWebinar

### [#4 Livestorm](https://serp.ly/livestorm/)

If you are looking for a webinar platform that includes a lot of product demos or training sessions, [Livestorm](https://serp.ly/livestorm/) is probably one of the best options for your company. 

The software can be used for webinars but can also be applied to online meetings and virtual events, knocking out tools for those categories if needed as well. It is designed to replace Zoom/Google hangout as your meeting software.  

You are able to collaborate with different hosts and let multiple people collaborate on a presentation. They have a dashboard of data and insights to help collect analytics and can even integrate with CMS platforms like Hubspot, Salesforce, and more to understand how your webinars are really helping.

Just like Demio, you can do live webinars as well as automated webinars.  This way, you can run your one live webinar and then allow automation to create sales for you at any other time of the day when you can’t operate a live one. 

#### **Pros** 

- Best for live training and product demos

### [#5 GetResponse](https://serp.ly/getresponse/)

If one of the things you look for with your company is simplicity, it can’t get easier than having your webinar platform also be your email marketing platform. Not only could it make reaching your audience and getting them into your webinars easier, but it makes everything under one roof, which makes it easier to juggle and on the wallet. 

Because this software is integrated with email marketing software, if you’re using GetResponse’s email marketing platform as well, you can segment your lists and create ultra-targeted webinars for people at certain levels of the buying ladder. 

Now, most email marketing solutions don’t charge a base price; it usually consists of how many emails are on your list. This is how the pricing is for this as well. This can get confusing depending on how many subscribers you have. 

Even though the platform’s primary focus is on email marketing, this is a good option for a company that wants decent webinar features while also keeping it simple and using one automation tool to run everything. 

#### **Pros** 

- Ability to integrate with email lists for specific targeting. 

- Whiteboards for notes and polls and surveys for feedback

- In Depth reporting and AB testing for analytics

- Page and email templates for webinar sign-ups

#### **Cons**

- Pricing is dynamic. Could become more in the long run.  

- Not as many bells and whistles as other options. 

#### **Pricing** 

- 30 Day Free Trial

- Basic Plan doesn’t come with webinar features

- Plus plan comes with webinar features up to 100 attendees. Starts at $49/month.

- Professional plan is up to 300 attendees and starts at $99/month. 

- If you need more attendees, you can contact them and get a specified quote. 

## Choosing The Best Webinar Software for You

With the five different software, there are some awesome features and benefits to each one. Now you just have to decide which one is best for your goals and budget. 

Here are a few things you need to ask to decide which one you would pick:

1. Do you need a certain software for more live webinars, or automated, or both?
2. Do you know how many attendees you can get? Some software has limits. 
3. Do you like the extra things like polls, pop-ups, and more?
4. Do you enjoy looking at analytics? Some platforms are better than others. 
5. Maybe most important, but what’s your budget? Could rule out some of these. 

Even if the last one does rule some out, every webinar software on here comes with a free trial or a $1 trial. So nothing is stopping you from trying any of these that you think would be a good fit.
