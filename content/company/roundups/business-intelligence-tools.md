## What are BI (Business Intelligence) Tools?

Software that gathers, processes, analyzes, and visualizes huge amounts of data to provide actionable business insights, creates interactive reports, and simplifies the decision-making process is a business intelligence tool (BI tool).

Visual analytics, [data visualization](https://devinschumacher.com/best/data-visualization-tools/), interactive dashboards, and KPI scorecards are all included in these business intelligence tools. In addition, they provide self-service capabilities for automated reporting & predictive analytics, making the analytical process more efficient and accessible.

## Why Do We need BI (Business Intelligence) Tools?

We are in the midst of a period of rapid technological advancement. The corporate sector has been particularly impacted by technological breakthroughs, which have had a profound influence on our day-to-day lives.

Businesses have more data-driven tools and tactics at their disposal than ever before, however, not everyone is making use of them. Today, we're going to discuss the importance of Business Intelligence and how it can help your company grow and thrive.

## The Benefits of BI (Business Intelligence) Tools

### Predictions can Benefit Users

Data scientists and analysts don't have to be experts in predictive analytics to benefit from it. Forecast engines allow business users of all skill levels to develop insights for future situations that will help them alter existing tactics to provide the best potential results.

To counter this, artificial intelligence-powered intelligent data alerts monitor for changes in business conditions and detect any abnormalities that may arise when managing massive volumes of data, allowing you to take prompt action.¬†

This degree of technology enables you to reduce the amount of manual effort and automate operations so that you may devote more time to other activities.

### They Gather All the Required Information

You likely acquire data from a variety of sources, including CRMs, flat files, portals, ERPs, database systems, APIs, and more. To handle all of these sources and gain a deeper knowledge of the gathered data, you'll need to create a high degree of data intelligence.

Because of this, contemporary data connectors may help you centralize diverse data sources & provide you with a single picture of all your business activities. Thus, recognizing issues and trends as well as cross-analytics & taking action are all tightly related and dependent exclusively on data.

### They Eliminate Manual Tasks

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/79pxKl6bwSD0m1gmalqgSmxoMSn08zpNSaZUZqS1PS-VNih3o-JMyzT5FRbLSByxr56Wo2cfm2emnC609WNmcv5qA8_nfhHJ3Lv7b-5vl14AdFEwC9-A7uKICTZTrru1w-Veaeb8IHN6Hmxz1tgy9hjHk1Dlc-S2u8ha7Am_k9d-1JGAAj8I45O1p3-Q)

Modern software removes endless columns and rows and allows for the automation of operations, whereas older methods of company administration promote the usage of spreadsheets and& static presentations.

Want a written report on the situation? In real time, the tool refreshes your KPI dashboard. It's also possible to schedule the reporting process to run at regular intervals so that you can focus on the findings.¬†

Have an idea for a speech?

A robust interactive dashboard may be created by simply dragging and dropping the variables you want to display on the dashboard. Data analysis will take on a far more natural approach now that tedious PowerPoint presentations are a thing of the past.

### Their Self-Serve Analytics Truly Liberate Data

There will be less need to request findings from the IT department if everyone in the firm has access to up-to-date business intelligence tools that allows them to independently investigate the data.¬†

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/xpUbkro3fT9J2bgMvFyIM-NhXsj6hKLy-fwRMcluhpz5UP2Qu2oEV0eXPFjfg9NjxaEmEPH_a6ksvFBvvORsRVPvUOSigd6S4VsTRrRQTS5Z4V5zNmsicZU-NU-WTgcBVw270IqM3uTNSvOYXqWBWxX1psUL753tauFBARh4TdNNJgjGHhpK6j3n-SfD)

Self-service BI enables firms to gain a competitive edge since each person will be armed with the correct quantity of data analytics abilities, saving time and money and allowing the IT staff to focus on other vital duties.

### They Help Businesses Save Money

It is possible to plan and analyze in real time with the help of BI tools, from sales forecasting to consumer behavior analysis. One study found that more than half of business intelligence customers cited cost savings and revenue growth as the most significant advantages of their software. As long as you can get the job done quickly and precisely, you'll have more success in the workplace and make more money.

## Features To Consider Before Choosing BI (Business Intelligence) Tools

### Data Warehouse

Without a data warehouse, it is feasible to create an effective business intelligence system. Even if you don't need one, it's among the most critical components of any BI strategy to take into account.¬†

Why?¬†

Simply said, a Data Warehouse improves the power, usefulness, and performance of your Business Intelligence investment while also making it easier to utilize.¬†

Matillion's Cloud-based Business Intelligence software as a service includes a Data Warehouse as one of its main features, and we believe strongly in the benefits it can bring to your organization.

### Data Visualization

Business Intelligence has become more popular and publicly available thanks in large part to the widespread use of data visualization. In recent years, it has grown in importance as a business intelligence element.

In today's fast-paced workplace, information must be passed down from one level of the company to the next prompt. It is possible to show enormous amounts of data in a more streamlined and user-friendly manner using excellent data visualization techniques.

### Reporting Based on One's Interests

There are only a few people in an organization who have the technical skills needed to produce and maintain standard business intelligence reports because of their complexity. As a result, the whole reporting process may be slowed down by bottlenecks accumulating around these crucial persons.

You need to seek reporting solutions that offer self-service reporting as one of the most important business intelligence capabilities. If you don't have the technical know-how to create sophisticated reports, a self-service reporting tool like Matillion can help you do so.

### In-Memory Analysis

Using in-memory analysis might be one of the most effective and easy-to-use business intelligence tools. With in-memory analysis, line-of-business users may do data analysis on their own, without the need for specialized knowledge or assistance from IT.¬†

Drill-down, grouping, filtering, and pivoting are all possible methods for users to use when posing and answering business questions.

It's also easy for them to compare performance across time, product groupings, client sectors, and geographic locations. If you have a lot of data to analyze, you don't have to worry about slowing down your production processes.

### Advanced Security

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hT_Mczn1PeZbQTqnKtmUMTghq-PvQ93GEvJ9-Hdk5bg-umDGWGst7YURsIFuDtTWUD8WFtg1lPjfVRqT4jR_VXKUCZDolKr-mLLIlpjTH4A9Ze-zQRulXpbbMY_WacSMKiEVOp60dWwvTCCHPf8gg2HYwSicp1zdAWHxpnI3ywNgiyS1R4L2saw4FFx-)

Among the most discussed BI aspects is security, especially concerning Cloud BI solutions. Previously, organizations preferred on-premise business intelligence solutions because of worries about security, but these issues are diminishing as suppliers offer more sophisticated and strict security measures.

One of the most significant characteristics of Matillion's business intelligence platform is security. You have complete control over who sees what in Matillion BI. It is possible to limit access to only the data necessary for a user by using groups and roles, and also row and column-based security.¬†

Managers, workers, and even vendors and customers may all benefit from BI when data is shared in this manner.

When it comes to cloud business intelligence, security is a top priority. Our safety measures are comprehensive. We employ encryption that goes above and beyond what is required by banks. ISO 27001, SAS Type II, and PCI-DSS certifications are all in place at our data centers.

### Fast Implementation

Conventional business intelligence software has the drawback of necessitating a lengthy and laborious setup procedure. With no in-house expertise, this procedure is considerably more challenging for firms.¬†

External consulting can cost anywhere from 100 percent to 300 percent of the initial program cost, according to the figures.

Fast and quick implementation is a critical element of any business intelligence solution. Experts are on board at every step of the deployment process when using a cloud-based BI system like Matillion BI. It's also possible to get up and running in only 4-6 weeks with our fixed-price implementation, so you don't have to worry about rising prices.

Unlimited tech support and training are included in your monthly subscription to our software-as-a-service approach.

### What is the Difference between ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) and BI (Business Intelligence) Software?

High-level talks about important strategic choices are aided by BI tools. All of your data, strategic and operational, may be accessed through these solutions (daily sales performance). As a result, corporate executives are better equipped to analyze data and make decisions that further their organizations' goals.

Despite this, an ERP is a system used to produce an operational perspective of your organization, typically without trend analytics, data comparison, or the development of insights into your company. ERP systems provide transactional, operational analytics compared to business intelligence (BI) systems.

### Is the Data I'm Storing for My Company Safe?

Any IT system must have high levels of data security and availability. A BI solution must be able to deliver the same degree of reliability, performance, and security as other platforms in your company. Existing security infrastructures are leveraged by reliable business intelligence (BI) solutions.

## Conclusion

There is an ever-growing amount of big data in the world, and it's just becoming bigger. Business Intelligence and business analytics solutions offer several benefits, such as making your data management more unified, reliable, flexible, and predictable through a wide range of capabilities.

We wanted to help you locate the greatest business intelligence tools on the market, & we hope that our detailed reviews of each product will motivate you to begin researching these tools and find the right fit for your organization or department.
