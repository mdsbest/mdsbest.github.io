## What is Screenwriting Software?

Like word processors, screenwriting software is a writing instrument made specifically for creating scripts and screenplays. Normal word processors, such as Microsoft Word, are unable to meet the unique requirements of screenwriters.

For instance, screenwriters who work with a large cast of characters require quick shortcuts when typing character names. Similar to novelists, screenwriters must take notes, work with other writers, and have quick access to an outline.

It also assists writers of screenplays in adhering to the strict formatting standards of the industry, studying and improving language use, maintaining document backups, and more. The need for manual formatting to bring your script into compliance with industry standards is eliminated by this software.

Screenwriting software essentially aids in the composition, editing, formatting, and printing of scripts for movies, television shows, or video games.

## Screenwriting Software Features

Writing screenplays and scripts requires the use of screenwriting software, which comes with a number of features and advantages.

**The following is a list of the main benefits you can anticipate from the top screenwriting software:**

- Ready-to-use templates and a simple interface that require little to no training assistance with mind maps and outlines

- Story map

- Drag-and-drop constructor

- Real-time interaction with stakeholders and other writers

- Uninterrupted writing

And now it’s time to go over the best free screenwriting software for you to use!
