## Review Of The Best Online Graphic Design Resources From Our Research

While most people recognize that some sort of graphics software is the primary tool to design your graphics, there are plenty of other tools to use.

Creating graphics will often involve combining multiple elements, many of which may not come with the graphics software you're using.

Some of these graphic tools can be very important in the final graphic a designer will create. These are some of the best online resources professional designers will often use to help create their graphics.

## Best Resource for Fonts - [MyFonts](https://serp.ly/myfonts/)

Fonts are an essential part of any graphic design. They add personality and emotion to a design, and they also make it easier for people to read your words.

But too many fonts can lead to confusion, so the best practice is often to use just one or two fonts per project. And best of all? You can find a font that will suit your needs at [MyFonts](https://serp.ly/myfonts/)!

MyFonts is an online marketplace for professional fonts with thousands of high-quality typefaces available for download. It’s free to browse their collection, but you have the option of purchasing even more premium fonts if you need them in order to complete your projects.

## Best Resource for Stock Images- [Unsplash](https://serp.ly/unsplash/)

A picture speaks a thousand words, so they say. And since many online graphic design software applications don't come with stock images, designers often have to find their own.  

[Unsplash](https://serp.ly/unsplash/) is the best online resource for free high-quality photos you can use in any project you're working on!

This site is run by photographers who want to share their best professional photos with the world. They donate their best photos, so you get free high-resolution photos that you can use for any project you're working on.

Every photo has a link back to the photographer, so it's best practice to follow suit and make sure that others give credit, too.

## Best Resource for Icons - [FlatIcon](https://serp.ly/flaticon/)

Vector graphics are best, but it can be extremely difficult to create them from scratch. If you find yourself in this situation a lot, Flaticon is the best online resource for vector icons!  

Flaticon has all the vector icon sets and individual icons that you'll need to make the best graphics possible.  They offer both free and premium vector icons depending on the kind of project you've got going.  

Some projects may only require a few simple icons and be best suited for Flaticon's free offerings, but other projects might need to use higher quality or unique icons.  If that's the case, you can still use Flaticon to get some premium ones.

## Best Resource for Design Inspiration - [Behance](https://serp.ly/behance/)

Online, users have several options when they want inspiration or tips for certain projects they need to complete.  

Behance is one of the best online resources for design inspiration and an ideal place to learn about new graphic design trends.  

Graphic designers love Behance because it helps give them some excellent inspiration, especially if they find themselves stuck on a project.

The best part about Behance is that it's free to use!

## Best Resource for Design Collaboration - [Figma](https://serp.ly/figma/)

Some graphic design projects will often require collaboration between different designers and departments within a company. Collaborating between different parties can often be difficult, but it doesn't have to be!

Figma isn't just a graphic design tool, but it can be used as one.  It acts more like an online cloud storage system with easy-to-access files for collaboration between multiple people.  

![screenshot of Figma dashboard](/images/figma-1024x604.png)

This makes Figma ideal for designers that work with multiple artists and even across multiple teams.  It's also a great tool for personal graphic design projects as well.
