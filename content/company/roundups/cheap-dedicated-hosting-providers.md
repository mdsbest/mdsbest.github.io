Then what are your options for a low-cost, dedicated hosting solution? That's something we understand. In this post, we'll take a look at six of the cheapest dedicated hosting plans on the market and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.

Here are a few things to keep in mind before we get into the specifics.

It is possible to host your website on a dedicated server that is solely dedicated to it. You're not competing with other websites for bandwidth, so a spike in traffic to your site shouldn't cause it to go down. In order to avoid making your consumers wait, try to maintain your load times as high as possible.

If the following describes your website's needs:

- Every week, tens of thousands of people visit.
- Is an online store that carries more than 30 products

It's a sign that your website is doing well if you seek a dedicated hosting package. It doesn't matter how successful your website is if you're paying $500 or more a month for a dedicated server. And if you're just moving from VPS, cloud, or shared hosting, you don't need to invest that much.

Dedicated server hosting is an area in which we've done a lot of investigation. We were able to find the finest dedicated server hosting services by trying to cross the features, rates, and customer support offered by the top hosts on the market. 

## **The Cheapest Dedicated Server Companies**

1. [Bluehost](https://serp.ly/bluehost/) – starts at $79.99 monthly
2. [InMotion](https://serp.ly/inmotion/) – starts at $105.69 monthly
3. [HostGator](https://serp.ly/hostgator/) – starts at $118.99 monthly
4. [iPage](https://serp.ly/ipage/) – starts at $119.99 monthly
5. [A2 Hosting](https://serp.ly/a2-hosting/) – starts at 141.09 monthly

We'll take a deeper look at these companies and see what you receive for your money. Below you'll find our rankings of the three lowest-cost dedicated server providers.

This list's lowest dedicated server hosts have all earned their place by offering considerable discounts to new customers. Comparing the lowest-cost dedicated server hosting options:

### **1\.** [Bluehost](https://serp.ly/bluehost/)**: $79.99 monthly** 

#### **4.6 out of 5**

- Uptime 4 out of 5 stars
- Features 3.3 out of 5 stars
- Support and Help 5 out of 5 stars
- Disk Space 4 out of 5 stars
- Pricing 4 out of 5 stars

#### **Pros**

- Included with the package are free backups (once enabled)
- Excellent uptime of 99.98%
- A one-year promotional price.
- Exceptional assistance and guidance

#### **Cons**

- Servers are located in only one place (Utah)
- Allowance for 5TB of bandwidth is relatively low.

But how does Bluehost stack up against other budget-friendly hosting providers like SiteGround and HostGator in our list of the best specialized hosting providers?

When it comes to functionality, Bluehost is a solid choice. It is #2 only to the more expensive HostGator in terms of uptime and storage at 99.98 percent.

However, [Bluehost](https://serp.ly/bluehost/) excels in customer service and support. At any time, you can get in touch with a representative of the Bluehost team. It’s easy to ignore help and assistance, but you’ll come to regret using it when your site breaks down when you can’t get in touch with someone to help!

Is there a drawback to Bluehost's Standard plan?

 It will take longer for your site to load outside of the United States because there is only one server location. If you see an unexpected spike in traffic, you may run into trouble because of the low bandwidth allowance.

### **2\.** [InMotion](https://serp.ly/inmotion/)**: $105.69 monthly**

#### **4.8 out of 5**

- Features 4.3 out of 5 stars
- Support and Help 5 out of 5 stars
- Uptime 3.5 out of 5 stars
- Disk Space 5 out of 5 stars
- Pricing 3.4 out of 5 stars

#### **Pros**

- Superb assistance and guidance
- 1 total of five IP addresses
- As your website expands, you can easily upgrade your plan.

#### **Cons**

- No freebie backups
- Only a 99.97% uptime assurance is provided.
- A total of just two U.S.-based data center locations are currently available

Dedicated server hosting from InMotion is the 3rd most economical option at $105.69 per month. But does it compete with the likes of Bluehost's feature-rich Bluehost when it concerns value?

I mean, it's not that simple. In terms of inexpensive dedicated hosting options, Essential is in the center of the pack.

The lone bright spot? 6 dedicated hosting plans are available from [InMotion](https://serp.ly/inmotion/), the most of any other host on this list. As your website expands, you can easily upgrade your plan without having to pay for anything you don't need.

### **3\.** [HostGator](https://serp.ly/hostgator/)**: $118.99 monthly**

#### **4.6 out of 5**

- Features 0 out of 5 stars
- Support and Help 5 out of 5 stars
- Uptime 4.5 out of 5 stars
- Disk Space 0 out of 5 stars
- Pricing 3.25 out of 5 stars

#### **Pros**

- Most reliable provider's uptime guarantee (99.99 percent )
- Up to 3 years of the discounted pricing can be locked in.
- Unrestricted internet access
- Having 1 terabytes of disk space is a huge advantage.

#### **Cons**

- There are no freebie backups.
- It's not the cheapest option.

Even though HostGator didn't win the prize for the cheapest dedicated hosting package, it is still our top-rated host, and for good reason! Although it is the lowest dedicated server hosting plan offered by HostGator, does the 'Value' plan live up to its name?

Yes, that's what we're hearing. There aren't many hosting companies out there that can match HostGator's 99.99 percent uptime guarantee, which is the best you're going to get since achieving 100 percent uptime is very difficult.

A gigantic 1 TB of all of the disk space is included in the value plan, making it an excellent option for those who need a lot of storage capacity. [HostGator](https://serp.ly/hostgator/) is a dependable and cost-effective hosting alternative because of its unmetered bandwidth and outstanding help and support rating.

The promotional pricing of $118.99 per month can be locked in for up to 3 years, plus you still have a 30-day money back guarantee option — a win-win situation!

### **4\.** [iPage](https://serp.ly/ipage/)**: $119.99 monthly** 

#### **4.2 out of 5**

- Features 3.5 out of 5 stars
- Support and Help 5 out of 5 stars
- Uptime 2 out of 5 stars
- Disk Space 4 out of 5 stars
- Pricing 3.5 out of 5 stars

#### **Pros**

- Helpful and supportive customer service
- Freebie backups.

#### **Cons**

- One server location, a small number of CPU cores, and a small quantity of RAM all add up to a sluggish website.
- Worst uptime assurance of any listed host (99.94 percent )

[iPage](https://serp.ly/ipage/) was formerly dubbed the "cheap and cheerful" hosting company, but when it refers to dedicated server host, it truly can't compete on either features or pricing. 

The uptime guarantee is a good place to start. iPage's 99.94% uptime guarantee is the poorest of any of the other providers on this list. The difference among 99.99 percent and 99.94 percent may not feel like too much, but when you consider that each 0.01 percent translates to about four hours per year, it suddenly becomes a lot more substantial.

On the cheapest dedicated hosting plan ('Startup'), you get only 2 CPU cores, 4 GB of RAM, plus one server location in the United States, which means your website could be slow and unstable.

### **5\.** [A2 Hosting](https://serp.ly/a2-hosting/)**: $141.09 monthly**

#### **4.3 out of 5**

- Features 3.65 out of 5 stars
- Support and Help 5 out of 5 stars
- Uptime 2.5 out of 5 stars
- Disk Space 4 out of 5 stars
- Pricing 3.65 out of 5 stars

#### **Pros**

- Servers are located throughout the United States, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region.
- Helpful and supportive customer service

#### **Cons**

- No free backups in this package.
- Poor uptime guarantee (99.95 percent )

The 'Sprint' Plan from A2 Hosting is just the sixth most affordable, and how does it compete in terms of value?

I'd say the response is "very good," but not exceptional. Sprint's plan is a respectable choice because of its 8GB of RAM, ample storage (2 x 500GB), and 4 server locations in the United States, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, but it doesn't provide anything special. As a result, the 99.95% uptime guarantee does not inspire much trust.

### **Dedicated Hosting for New Customers at a Low Price**

We'll let you in on something secret if you're looking for an inexpensive dedicated hosting plan: most hosting companies give amazing promotional discounts to new clients, and these deals often endure for the first year or more. As far as discounts go, we're talking about more than half off—not just a few bucks here and there.
