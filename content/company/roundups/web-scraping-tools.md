# The World's Best Web Scraping Software, Tools & APIs

Automated large-scale data extraction from websites is known as web scraping. Web scraping or web crawling techniques are being used more frequently to gather data from the internet and gain insights for personal or professional use as every industry in the world becomes dependent on data.

You can download structured data in CSV, Excel, or XML formats using web scraping tools and software, saving time compared to manually copying and pasting this data. In this article, we'll look at some of the best web scraping tools and programs, both free and paid.

## What is Web Scraping?

People and businesses who want to use the huge quantity of publicly available web data to make better decisions typically use web data extraction (web scraping).

If you've ever manually copied and pasted content from a website, you've already performed the same task as a web scraper. Web scraping uses intelligent automation to gather hundreds, millions, or even billions of data points from the internet's seemingly limitless frontier, as opposed to the tedious, mindless process of manually extracting data.

A Node library called Puppeteer offers a robust but user-friendly API that lets you manage Google's headless Chrome browser. A headless browser lacks a graphical user interface (GUI), but it can send and receive requests.

It operates in the background and carries out tasks as directed by an API. By typing where they type and clicking where they click, you can mimic the user experience.

Puppeteer works best for web scraping when the data you need is produced by a combination of API data and Javascript code. Puppeteer can also be used to capture screenshots of web pages that are automatically displayed when a web browser is launched.

### Playwright

Microsoft developed the Node library called Playwright specifically for automating browsers. It makes cross-browser web automation efficient, dependable, and quickly possible.

Playwright was developed to enhance automated UI testing by removing flakiness, enhancing execution speed, and providing insights into browser functionality. It is a more recent tool for automating browsers and shares many characteristics with Puppeteer.

It also comes pre-bundled with compatible browsers. Its greatest strength is cross-browser compatibility; it can power Firefox, WebKit, and Chrome. Playwright has continuous integrations with Travis CI, AppVeyor, Azure, Docker, and Travis CI.

### PJscrape

A web scraping framework called PJscrape was created in Python using Javascript and JQuery.

It is designed to run with PhantomJS, enabling you to scrape pages from the command line in a fully rendered, Javascript-enabled context without the need for a browser.

The full browser context is used to evaluate the scraper functions. This implies that in addition to having access to the DOM, Javascript variables and functions, AJAX-loaded content, etc. are also accessible.

## How to choose a web scraping tool

If the amount of data needed is small and the source websites are straightforward, web scraping tools, both free and paid, and self-service software/applications may be a good option.

Web scraping tools and software are not scalable when there are a lot of websites to scrape, have complex logic, or need to bypass a CAPTCHA.

A full-service provider is a more advantageous and cost-effective choice in such circumstances.

These web scraping tools easily extract data from web pages, but they have their limitations. In the long run, programming is the most effective method for web data scraping because it offers more flexibility and produces better outcomes.

There are excellent web scraping services that will suit your needs and make the job simpler for you if you lack programming skills, have complex requirements, or need a lot of data to be scraped.

By using this guide instead‚Äîyou‚Äôll learn what is required to use any of the tools mentioned and they will only provide clean data to you‚Äîyou can save time and obtain clean, structured data.

## Final Thoughts

Data is the new oil, but not everyone can take advantage of its value without a useful tool. Whether or not a person can code, data scraping tools are working to make data more accessible to everyone. By doing this, everyone can access the necessary data and use it to analyze it to produce value for the world.
