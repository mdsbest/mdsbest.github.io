## FAQs

### What Is Software for Email Marketing?

Users of email marketing software can develop, send, and track emails to their subscriber lists.

Using software makes it simpler to develop effective emails and gives you access to crucial statistics like open rates and click-through rates. Because the email is more tailored to the recipient's interests thanks to advanced platforms, there is a higher chance that they will interact with it.

Almost every industry can benefit from email marketing as a marketing technique. For instance, if a customer leaves an item in their shopping basket, an [online retailer](https://devinschumacher.com/review/algo-online-retail-course/) can automatically send them a follow-up email to remind them to complete the transaction.

A SaaS product can persuade users to demo a product, and based on whether the lead accepts their offer, users can choose how persistently to follow up. Even though email marketing is by no means a novel strategy, industry reports have shown it to be beneficial year after year.

### How Much Does Email Marketing Software Cost?

Software for email marketing often offers several plans depending on how many connections you have. The least expensive package often costs nothing or $50 per month.

The most expensive package might run you thousands of dollars each month. The majority of plans feature at least a two-week free trial period and give customers who pay annual discounts.

How many features you require and how actively you use email marketing will determine how much you pay. This is because most [software bases its fees either on the volume of emails stored in the database](https://devinschumacher.com/database-software/) or on the volume of emails sent.

As a result, it's critical to closely monitor your behavior to determine whether your monthly expenses are rising.

### Email Marketing: Is it included in CRM software?

You can email contacts that are stored in the database with some [CRM software](https://devinschumacher.com/crm-software/). It does not, however, have the extensive feature set that software made specifically for email marketing will have.

The email marketing feature in a CRM is mostly intended for users who just occasionally need to send emails and don't require a design or automated campaigns.

It makes sense to purchase a different email marketing software from your CRM if you want to automate automations to enhance subscriber engagement or if you want more sophisticated reporting.

### What Usually Comes With Email Marketing Software?

You can create emails, add contacts, schedule email campaigns, and view data on how your emails are performing with almost all email marketing tools.

By using sophisticated software, you can automate emails based on how contacts interact with any of your marketing platforms, A/B split test different sections of the email, and segment your contact list based on interests.

Additionally, most lead-generating tools allow you to add lead forms to your website and build landing pages to increase the number of subscribers in the database.

## TL;DR

We recommend **[Active Campaign](https://serp.ly/active-campaign)** as the best email marketing software for growing & monetizing your list.
