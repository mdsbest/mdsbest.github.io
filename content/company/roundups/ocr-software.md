## Buyer's Guide For OCR Software

OCR software is a must-have if you need scanned documents, the ability to convert images and export documents, and more. In order to determine exactly which software to choose, you'll have to take a look at all of their features and make a decision based on what your needs are.

The differences between OCR software aren't too large but they are significant enough to influence your purchase choice. In any case, you first need to look at what you (or your company) needs, what file formats you use, how large your budget is (if any), etc.

### File Format

If we look at OCR software's primary purpose, which is the ability to convert scanned documents into editable PDF files, it's easy to assume that all OCR software supports the same file formats. Alas, that is not the case.

If you or your company are looking to convert JPEG and PNG images, that's the type of software you need. It's best if you firstly go over the files you have to determine what formats you'll want the software to support.

### Accuracy

Whether it's free OCR software or paid, all of them come with a predetermined accuracy. Most of these claim to have between 95% and 99% accuracy; keep in mind that this accuracy refers to 'character errors' and not word errors. So even a 90% accuracy software is a good deal.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/giphy-1-1.webp)

Another thing to research or ask the OCR software company is the text scanning specifications. What kind of fonts can the software recognize, can it distinguish and properly convert documents written in handwriting, etc.

Lastly, OCR software's ability to convert PDF files with maximum efficiency depends on the resolution, straightness, discoloration, and brightness of the original document or image. OCR scanning isn't always precise but you can improve its accuracy by providing valid documents (or better yet, documents that fit what the software is looking for).

### Price and Features

The best OCR software can be free and paid. It all depends on the number of image files or other types of documents you want to convert. If it's just multiple documents at one time, then your best bet would be free.

Otherwise, paid OCR software comes with a wide variety of features and even multiple languages. In general, document processing is somewhat similar across all OCR software but the extra features from paid versions can come in handy.

## Frequently Asked Questions For OCR Software

### Is using OCR software difficult?

It isn't inherently difficult as in, it would take a lot of time to use. What can be considered difficult is simply the learning process. Each software has its own UI and methodology so it might take a while until you learn.

In general, you'll very quickly learn how to scan documents, use the various OCR tools, and ultimately create PDFs.

### Can OCR software extract text from images such as screenshots?

Yes! Most OCR can achieve this with no difficulty. It basically doesn't matter what type of image documents you want to be converted, as long as the software supports the file format. Getting structured data from various kinds of digital files includes screenshots as well.

The most important part about this is getting editable files that you can then use to create PDF documents. Just make sure what file formats the software supports and you're good to go!

### Can a scanned PDF file with images be converted with OCR software?

Yes, it can. Most OCR technology is perfectly capable of converting a scanned document (such as a PDF) into an editable file. These converted files also come out as PDFs but you can edit any piece of extracted data.

The PDF format is widely used in virtually all OCR software as output and input so in a way - it can be considered a 'PDF tool' of sorts.

### What are the benefits of using an OCR tool for document processing?

There are plenty of benefits to using OCR software that automatically extracts data:

1. **Accuracy -** OCR is a much more accurate system of data entry than doing it by hand. The human error factor is eliminated, thus causing all files to be nigh-perfect upon inspection. OCR accuracy is one of the most important metrics when selecting the software that fits your needs best.
2. **Lowered long-term costs -** Usually, you'd have to pay an experienced person to dabble with data extraction. An AI-based OCR software would maybe cost something initially or have a monthly subscription, but in the long run, it's better to invest in OCR than not.
3. **Data processing speed -** Whether you're doing some batch processing or single-document conversion, OCR is more than ten times quicker than manual data entry. In addition, scanning paper documents and digitizing them takes almost no time out of your day when using OCR.
4. **Document management -** If you like your scanned PDF files nice and orderly organized, then OCR is the helping hand you'd want. What's great about OCR is that it features a searchable files system where you can quickly locate your converted files.

### What are the downsides of using advanced OCR to digitize documents?

Although OCR software can automatically detect printed text, export PDFs, and extract data - it's not all sunshine and rainbows.

1. **Potential issues with text conversion -** Some OCR programs can't properly convert paper documents if there's handwriting on them. Some fonts can also be impossible to read by the software and you need to keep the text nice and level. Otherwise, the tilt will also cause issues.
2. **Issues with text in scanned images -** Unless the image is crystal clear, in high resolution, and the text is clearly visible - the OCR engine usually won't be able to distinguish the text. This can also influence OCR accuracy so make sure your images are high-quality.
3. **Inability to fix spelling errors -** Due to its nature, most OCRs cannot properly fix spelling or writing errors from scanned documents. You would have to do this manually through the software itself before exporting the finalized PDF files.

## Final Thoughts

Thanks to the advancement of technology, we can easily scan and extract data from various images or PDF documents. OCR has some incredible benefits hence why most companies that deal with documents and paperwork use it today.

With sufficient OCR accuracy and numerous output formats, this software is perfect when you're in a rush and want to get your documents nice and editable!

As for which OCR engine and software is the best - there are multiple 'best ones'. [Adobe Acrobat](https://serp.ly/adobe-acrobat-pro-dc/) is a great choice but you need a monthly subscription, whilst Tesseract is completely free and perfect for mobile devices.

In the end, as long as the software can convert PDFs and other files, it will be an excellent fit for you. Just make sure that the software supports the file formats you need.
