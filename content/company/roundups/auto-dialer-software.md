### [Voicent](https://serp.ly/voicent/)

For companies that conduct sales and lead generation efforts through the telephone, but don't use it nearly as much as a call center would, they should give [Voicent](https://serp.ly/voicent/) serious consideration.

That's because Voicent offers the most flexible pricing packages of any auto dialer software we reviewed. This is preferable for businesses that perhaps don't want to pay hundreds of dollars per user on a monthly basis.

Voicent's pricing starts at just $19 per month for every user. You will have to pay for the minutes each user uses but at least this starting subscription is significantly lower than other auto dialers.

Voicent's software can be installed on any PC or Mac computer and allows you to send out recorded messages. You get an easy interface to record your message, set the time it will be sent, and add some personalization such as company name, contact number, and email address.

Once this has been done, all you have to do is press play and Voicent auto dialer does the rest of the work for you. The best thing about it is that it’s very user-friendly and is easy to learn and get accustomed to using.

For best results, the Voicent auto dialer needs to be used in conjunction with a pre-recorded message. You can record your own using the best quality telephone recorder (which is included in the package) or you can choose from several professionally recorded messages available on the Internet.

- The more calls you make, the more minutes you use, and these minutes can add up in terms of cost.

**Pricing**

For companies that conduct a lot of business through phone calls but maybe not nearly the level of a call center, Voicent's pricing is very fair and affordable. On top of that, you even get a 30-day free trial to test out their software and see if it's the right fit for your company.

Much like a mobile phone plan, Voicent offers a base monthly or yearly fee and usage fees on a pay-as-you-go basis.

For example, their subscription fee works out to $29 per month per user when you pay for it monthly. If you pay for it on an annual basis, that amount shrinks to $19 per month.

If you are a call center, here is the pricing breakdown of inbound and outbound calls.

## Buyer's Guide For Best Auto Dialer Software

### What is auto dialer software?

Autodialer software is any program that makes it easy to automate the process of calling. Instead of manually keying in the numbers to make a call, auto-dialing software simply takes phone numbers from a list and automatically places the call for you.

![](/images/the-autodialer-makes-sure-your-working.jpg)

But, what takes auto dialing software to the next level is its ability to filter through the calls. What this means is that instead of wasting time dialing the number and hearing nothing but ringing, auto dialing software will actually connect you, the user, to only the people who pick up the phone.

This ability to reduce the inefficiency of manually dialing one number at a time is great for businesses that deal with a high volume of phone calls.

Some of the best auto dialer software can not only place calls for you, but they can also do so much more. Many of them have integration features with popular CRM's such as Salesforce. If an auto dialer is integrated with a CRM, it will make note-taking and call-tracking much easier to record and have a record of it on file.

### Who is auto dialer software for?

The best auto dialer software is the perfect tool for companies and businesses that deal with a heavy volume of phone calls.

These companies can range from a call center to political campaigns, charitable organizations, or any sales-oriented business.

There are many reasons why these companies would want to use an auto dialer. For one, it improves the operational efficiency of sales agents in that less time is wasted with each call and between each call.

Another factor is that the leads generated from an auto dialer are much better simply because agents will be connected only with those that pick up the phone. Those that pick up the phone are already that much closer to being closed as a lead or a customer than someone who doesn't answer the phone.

![](/images/trying-to-calculate-benefits-of-auto-dialer.jpg)

Since many auto dialers can be integrated with a CRM, it makes the tracking of conversations easy. This is beneficial for companies because conversations that have records in the CRM can be viewed by anyone in the company and a different sales agent can pick up right where the conversation left off.

Lastly, in the event that someone doesn't pick up the phone when the auto dialer calls, it also allows you to leave a message on their answering machine if they have one. For the people that do end up calling back, they will be able to speak with an agent who can then carry out the sales process.

Auto dialer software is vital for companies looking to scale up their [sales](https://devinschumacher.com/sales/) and [lead generation](https://devinschumacher.com/). As such, it's also a terrific way for sales teams to efficiently place outbound calls and increasing their conversion rates on leads.

### What features in an auto dialer software should people/companies be looking for?

The best auto dialer software all does one thing great: they auto dial the numbers you tell it to! Aside from that, some auto dialers have features that others don't have.

We have identified a handful of features you should carefully consider your next auto dialer to have for it will just give your organization more flexibility and value.

**Automation**

This one is kind of obvious but there are ways an auto dialer software provides automation. We all know the software can auto dial numbers but some of the best ones come with an automated voice.

A helpful tip here is to find an auto dialer software that allows you to pre-record a message that you can leave for people that don't pick up the phone and it goes to their voicemails. The best auto dialers are able to recognize answering machines and can then leave the pre-recorded message on their voicemail.

![](/images/needs-more-automation.jpg)

Some other software also has a preview dialing feature. This feature is useful for sales agents especially because it lets them see who the auto dialer is calling. If there is a history or records of previous conversations with these people, it can help a sales agent figure out where the touchpoint last left off and how they can resume the engagement.

**Integration with your CRM**

We already briefly touched on this but auto dialers that have some form of integration with a CRM will greatly improve efficiency. Nothing will be more inefficient than having to manually transfer customer records from one software to another, especially if your business deals with a large volume of phone calls.

We should note that specific CRM integration can limit your search for auto dialing software. However, many of the best ones offer integration with more of the popular CRMs so it should not be too much of an issue.

If you aren't currently using a CRM, that's okay too!

Some of the best auto dialers come with their own built-in CRM. While it may not be as robust in features as a more conventional CRM, it should suffice for basic record and note-taking needs.

**In The Office, At Home, or Anywhere Else**

Whether you're in the office, working from home, or in a completely different country, some of the best auto dialer software will work anywhere.

As long as you have an internet connection, an auto dialing software like PhoneBurner allows you to place a call directly from the software. While this feature isn't the norm, it is an excellent one to have because of its flexibility.

This remote feature won't hinder or disrupt a team's workflow either because there are plenty of automation features that allow for follow-up.

More companies are allowing employees to work remotely and auto dialing software that is able to accommodate such a work arrangement will boost productivity.

**Easy to Use/Learn**

Learning how to use new software can be daunting. Especially ones that come packed with plenty of neat features.

Fortunately, the vast majority of auto dialing software is fairly easy to learn and use. Auto dialer software is designed to streamline phone dialing inefficiencies, even at a call center!

Despite this, everyone's level of comfort with new software and technology is different. You'll have to carefully evaluate whether the auto dialer you choose is right for your entire organization.

If you feel that some sales agents at your call center are struggling with one auto dialer, it might be wise to find another one that perhaps, offers better training sessions.

At the end of the day, your sales agents, team members, and departments all must feel comfortable using the software. This is the only way you're going to get the most value out of it and improve workflow.

## Frequently Asked Questions For Auto Dialer Software

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/LFRxxYFu_YoJH4QXRzLs2NRwA69tcT4xNmBgAeCejzDG5fa9I_h53UwPXYNApM5H9blLduYSEMt8N759cf_eDT3jU3cS_wG3QdXDy-xvcYw598iGxmCB8dmhIuKTmxl0Fy20Yxzq=s0)

### What is a progressive dialer?

 A progressive dialer automates the process of calling phone numbers sequentially. When one number doesn’t answer, it will try another number and so on until either someone picks up or it runs out of numbers to call.

There are advantages and disadvantages to this type of system. It can be very beneficial because you can do other tasks while your calls are being made for you, but there is also a chance that people may not want to hear from you again if they were bothered too many times in a short span.

### What is a predictive dialer?

Predictive dialers can automatically predict and call the next number in your list or wait until you're ready before calling the number. If no one answers, it will either keep trying different numbers until someone picks up or stop altogether.

Predictive dialing will save time and money by reducing the amount of effort needed to make calls manually. In addition, it may also improve customer service with fewer dropped connections or busy signals because they're being routed through a computer instead of a human being.

This way you don't have to worry about being on the phone all day long and can spend time doing other things while still making outbound calls!

### What is preview dialing?

Preview dialing involves the process of "previewing" a contact's record and information and deciding whether to call them based on their information.

How this process works is that if an auto dialer has preview dialing, it will select a contact or a batch of contacts for an agent to review. The agent will then carefully review these records and decide to call them based on their final review.

This can be a tremendously helpful tool for sales agents because it takes away the process of them having to look over each contact record manually. Oftentimes, there can be hundreds and thousands of contact records and it would be a tedious process to review each one.

Preview dialing does most of the heavy lifting and the sales agent just has to approve (or reject) whether or not to call a contact.

## Final Thoughts

Long gone are the days of payphones and manual dialing a rotary phone.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/mvzzsk_uZRZjhcGMqET9j3fUwh8sTPMJWq_9DGjbmHjgCfVZQr_QUArNT7xiwztb49jo56_XKNt8LUh-zf2J2P6oY8V396B8rgLT-r1VgtW194QFOZFgXyL7Ys4RzcvT1KEQimWm=s0)

Today, people and companies are all about efficiency and as we have seen, there are different auto dialing solutions out there. Using software to help make a phone call can cut down on time spent dialing one number at a time and it also improves productivity in the workplace.

For teams that deal with massive volumes of calls such as a call center, a political campaign, or a charity conducting a fundraising drive, auto dialers can help weed out bad numbers to call and save time.

If you operate a business where the primary mode of conducting business is through making calls, you should consider any one of the best auto dialer software.
