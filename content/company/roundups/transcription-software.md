Transcription software can be used to transcribe audio files in a variety of different formats, including MP3, WAV, and AIFF. There are a variety of different transcription software programs available on the market, ranging from free to subscription-based.

The features and functionality of transcription software can vary depending on the program you choose.

When choosing transcription software, it is important to consider the features you need and the price you are willing to pay. Some transcription software programs offer a free trial period, so you can try out the software before you commit to a subscription.

### Types of Transcription Services

The first type of transcription software is dictation software. This type of software is designed for people who want to [transcribe their own voice recordings - perfect for podcasters](https://devinschumacher.com/podcast-recording-software/) who want to repurpose their content..

It is usually very user-friendly and can be used by people of all transcription experience levels. The second type of transcription software is speech-to-text software.

It is the most versatile type of transcription software and can be used for a variety of purposes.

Automatic transcription software is the quickest and most affordable option, but it is also the least accurate. This type of software uses speech recognition technology to translate audio into text. While it can be helpful in some situations, it is not recommended for use with important or sensitive audio files.

Manual transcription software is more accurate than automatic software, but it is also more time-consuming and expensive. This type of software requires you to listen to an audio file and type out what you hear. While it can be tedious, it is the best option for important or sensitive audio files.

### Feature Considerations

#### Cost and Turnaround Time

As a small business owner, I am always looking for ways to cut costs. One area that I have found to be quite expensive is transcription services. I often need to transcribe audio and video files, and the cost can add up quickly.

There are many transcription services that charge on a per-minute basis. For example, a 30-minute transcription at $1 per minute would cost $30. And if you need a faster turnaround time, verbatim files (meaning they include all the "ums" and "ahs"), or if the audio is of poor quality, you may be charged extra.

If you find yourself transcribing audio and video files often, a subscription service such as Otter or Trint may be the best value for you. As you might guess, the amount of time it takes to turn around a file usually depends on its length. Automatic services can typically process a file in a matter of minutes. Human-powered services take quite a bit longer and you may have to pay for faster delivery speeds.

Rev is simple in that it promises to return your file (in most cases) in a 12-hour timeframe. GoTranscript's slowest option (five days) are also their cheapest, though you can fast-track that to 6-12 hours for an additional $3.00 per minute. There are intermediary options for the service as well.

So if you are in need of transcription services, be sure to shop around and find the best option for you in terms of cost and turnaround time.

#### Audio Quality and Accuracy

As someone who relies on transcription software to get my work done, I was surprised to find out just how much audio quality and accuracy can vary from one service to another. I tested out a few different services and found that the overall accuracy of transcripts varied considerably.

In my testing, I used two different files: an excerpt from a two-person podcast designed for people learning English and a recording featuring three sports pundits talking about their expectations for the upcoming basketball season.

The results were interesting, to say the least. For the podcast excerpt, I found that all of the services did a decent job of transcribing the conversation. However, there was one service that was significantly more accurate than the others.

For the recording of the sports pundits, things were a bit more hit or miss. One service did a decent job, while the others struggled to understand the fast-paced, colloquial speech.

Overall, I was surprised by how much audio quality and accuracy can affect the transcriptions. If you rely on transcription software for your work, it's important to choose a service that can provide accurate transcripts.
