Content is a must for businesses who use sales, digital marketing, social media, & blogging for SEO. The content industry is forecasted to reach $418 billion in revenue by 2025. The difficulty is that it takes time and effort to develop new material.

Because of this, several artificial intelligence writing software solutions have appeared to assist content producers. Because of the sophistication of today's AI writing tools, you can now produce material half of the time.

Each of these instruments has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Jasper is probably the most well-known, however, it's primarily used for ad copy. Whereas programs like WriteSonic & Copy.AI have more feature - they are essentially the same thing.

A nice arbitrage opportunity of throwing a GUI on top of GPT3.

They can, however, help you create long-form content quickly and easily, as well as improve your articles for [search engine](https://devinschumacher.com/search-engines/) optimization.

If you don't like reading, and just want to get to (not) writing, here is our list of top recommended AI writing tools:

1. [Copy.ai](https://serp.ly/copyai)

3. [Writesonic](https://serp.ly/writesonic)

5. [Jasper](https://serp.ly/jasper)

## What is AI Writing Software?

A form of program that can produce material for you is AI writing software. Writing essays, books, blog entries, and more has never been easier with the help of an AI-powered writing helper. Those are only a few of the advantages of using AI authoring tools.

You may use AI writing as a supplement to your repertoire of skills. If you've ever used any AI authoring tool, you already know how useful it can be. But you also understand that they won't be able to completely replace human intellect any time soon.

## Why Do We need AI Writing Tools?

Utilizing AI writing software offers several advantages, like saving time, lowering the burden, and producing high-quality articles.

AI writing software may automate big portions of your content production process, which is excellent because you won't just have to spend as much time developing written articles.

### Get Quality Content Faster

Every blogger is constantly on the lookout for methods to make more time for their writing. AI writing tools may also be able to aid. The fact is that these AI writing assistants can help you produce high-quality material in a short time and save you time by making the writing process more efficient.

If you're like me and trying to find methods to save time while still producing high-quality material for your blog, then you should give their AI article writing software a shot. I highly recommend ShortlyAI for those who are just getting started with these kinds of technologies. It's one of the greatest artificial intelligence (AI) blog post writing tools out there, and it's quite easy to use.

### Avoid Writer’s Block

Every writer has to struggle with writer's block at some point in time. There are times when it is highly aggravating and it can harm productivity and lead to a delay in work.

Use the AI Writer software if you're having trouble writing because of writer's block. They're growing better and better at writing. Writer's block is no match for them. So, there's no need to worry about writer's block anymore.

You only need to tell the AI writer software what you want to publish and how you want it to sound, and it will take care of the rest. Writer's block will be a thing of the past for you now.

### Make Money as Content Writer

The ability to work as a full-time freelancing content writer utilizing AI helper tools is one of the most significant advantages of employing these technologies. Several internet firms are seeking content writers who can produce their articles. Using these tools, you may write their material and get paid for it.

In the very same amount of time, you can write five times as many articles with AI authors than you can with manual writing. Using AI writing software can increase your earnings as an article writer by 5 times. It's for this reason that I strongly advocate using these tools if you're interested in making income as a content writer.

### Save on content costs

Utilizing AI writer tools may help you produce content without having to pay a high-priced copywriter or article writer. Professional content writers & copywriters are expensive to hire if you're running an internet business.

So, if you're on a small budget but yet want to generate high-quality content, adopting AI copywriting tools could be a fantastic choice. It is a win-win situation.

### Helps You in Copywriting

When it comes to improving your copywriting talents, adopting AI copywriting tools may be a smart option. You can learn a lot from these tools since they can develop some wonderful sales copy for you.

In addition, they may assist you in creating engaging content for your clientele. It will assist you to develop a sales copy that sounds like it was prepared by a professional copywriter.

## Features To Consider Before Choosing AI Writing Software

Do you even want an AI writer? Or do you want a paraphraser?

Have a look through this video on [Quillbot](https://serp.ly/quillbot) - the World's best paraphrasing tool - and then answer that question.

### Plagiarism Checking

Plagiarism is one of the most difficult issues that website owners have to grapple with constantly. When purchasing an AI tool, be sure that it contains an in-built plagiarism detector if you're a blogger who publishes articles.

Although most AI writing programs provide original material, you should not rely on them without verifying their claims. A plagiarism detector may be used to guarantee that the information created is unique and not taken from any other source.

If the program doesn't include a built-in plagiarism checker, you may still use it, but you'll need to manually copy and paste the created material into plagiarism software to verify its authenticity. It will take quite some time & waste your time. So, always go for an AI writing program that includes built-in plagiarism checking.

### Price 

The price of an AI writing software is a crucial consideration when making a purchasing decision. At a lower cost, other AI programs give additional word credits and the same features. Always be sure that you must be comparing tools with the same specifications before making a purchase.

### Supported Languages

If you want to write material in many languages, you must ensure that the writing software you're using supports those languages. Numerous AI content writing technologies can produce material in more than 25 languages.

If you want to create material in different languages, be sure to look at the list of languages supported by the writing tool you intend to purchase.

### Capacity to Create Blog Posts and Other Long-form Content

So if you're a blogger or novelist who wishes to employ an AI tool to write blog articles or books. Then, you need to see if the AI tool you're considering purchasing can write long-form material (like books and blog articles) or not.

If a tool can just produce short-form material, like emails or [social media](https://devinschumacher.com/social-media-marketing-tools/) posts, you should not spend your cash on such AI writing solutions. They are great for long-form material like blog entries, novels, tales, essays, etc. because both products come with a long-form Assistant tool.

### The Quality of the Content Produced by the Company

The caliber of the created material is also an important factor to consider. If you feed the same data into two different AI programs, you'll notice that the output quality varies. This is because of the algorithm that they employ.

As I said before, each AI content authoring tool has a unique algorithm. If you input the same data, they provide different results, even if you do so with the same input.

### SEO Mode

If you're a blogger seeking the best AI article writing tool, you should examine if the tool you're purchasing includes SEO integration. 95% of AI products do not have SEO integration options.

So, if you want to use an AI blog article writing tool to generate SEO-optimized posts, don't buy certain AI content writing tools that don't come with SEO integration.

## Popular AI (& Other) Writing Tools

### #1. [Jasper](https://serp.ly/jasper)

In terms of functionality, Jasper falls in between GrowthBar & Copy AI. Short-form features include product descriptions and blog post ideas, while long-form content assistants aid you in writing blog articles and Google Ads, Ads on Facebook, and LinkedIn Ads. The product is sleek, contemporary, and extremely user-friendly.

#### Features: 

- Teamwork is a key component of the software.

- Among the more than 50 templates available for AI-generated copy are those for Google Ads, Facebook Ads, LinkedIn Ads, and a variety of other types of advertising.

- Each month, you'll have access to all Fifty templates, 50,000 words, and Boss Mode for $59.

#### Verdict:

Like GrowthBar and other long-form SEO tools, this product lies somewhere in the middle of a comprehensive suite of copywriting tools (such as Copy AI). I decided to give it a go and came up with some material. The AI's results were adequate, but far from ideal. As a result, I have to spend more time editing Jasper's output than I'd like to.

### [Copy AI](https://serp.ly/copyai)

CopyAI is an AI writing tool with a condensed form.

Email textual content, blog headlines, product descriptions, social media captions, and brainstorming are just a few examples of the short-form material that may be generated with this tool.

Teams working on content find it to be an ideal tool. Copy AI, like GrowthBar, is built upon GPT-3, which ensures that its outputs are accurate and unique.

#### Features: 

- Efforts aimed at attracting new customers

- Text on a website: hero and meta descriptions

- Copy for digital ads: Facebook, Google, and LinkedIn

- A variety of content for use on social networking platforms, such as Instagram and Twitter.

#### Companies Using the Software:

Ogilvy, eBay, Nestle, and Microsoft

#### Pricing:

- Copying is completely free. If you want to use AI for free, you can receive 10 bits of copy, but that won't go you very far.

- Information on the cost of the enterprise is not available.

#### Verdict:

As a growth marketer, you'll find Copy AI to be a transforming tool. You can create copies of just about anything using it. It's a great tool, but it does need some human intervention to ensure that your material is ready for consumption by your customers.

### [Rytr](https://serp.ly/rytr)

As with Copy AI & Jarvis, Rytr can do a variety of different types of copywriting. For a variety of purposes, including business pitches, brand names, call-to-actions, email and Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn advertisements as well as product descriptions and meta descriptions, it employs artificial intelligence to produce unique material. It's an easy-to-use application that quickly produces unique content.

- Freebies abound in this arrangement.

- Content outputs that have been well-honed mean that text production is quite accurate.

#### Companies Using the Software:

Freshworks, Ikea, PWC, Ford, Payoneer, and Adidas

#### Pricing:

- Free: 5,000 monthly characters are generated for nothing more than a [credit card](https://devinschumacher.com/secured-credit-cards/) number.

- 50,000 characters a month for $9 a month.

- Unlimited: $29 a month for an unlimited number of characters to be generated each month.

#### Verdict:

Good things come in little packages, and Rytr falls under that category. Generally, the AI material outputs are error-free, and its free plan is among the best options available here. AppSumo advertises a "lifetime plan" that is quite inexpensive.

It's worth a spin for that reason alone. I think it's a great tool for journalists as well as other long-form authors who aren't as worried about SEO recommendations.

### [GrowthBar](https://serp.ly/growthbar)

Bloggers & content creators can't go wrong with GrowthBar, the greatest SEO tool.
