If you want to start live streaming, you‚Äôre going to need a few things. The first two things you need are some device to stream from, like a PC, video game console, or phone, and an internet connection.¬†

The next thing you will need is broadcasting software. This software encodes what your device is seeing and broadcasts it out to the world on one of the many streaming platforms.¬†

Two of the top options for broadcasting software are [Streamlabs](https://serp.ly/streamlabs/) OBS and [OBS Studio](https://serp.ly/obs/).¬† There are many differences and similarities between these two platforms but in this post, we‚Äôre going to delve into the pros and cons of each, what you might need to spend to use the software, and which one would be best for your needs.¬†

## [OBS](https://serp.ly/obs/)

OBS has been around since 2012 and was one of the first open-source broadcasting platforms to come out. As a result, almost every other [streaming software](https://devinschumacher.com/streaming-software/) is influenced by the code found in OBS Studio.¬†

OBS stands for Open Broadcaster Software and is free to use and open-source, meaning that anyone can view the code. This allows coders and developers to create other projects like Streamlabs OBS or create plug-ins and add-ons to improve OBS, as we‚Äôll see below.¬†

### OBS Studio Pros

#### Open-Source Coding

Even though we just mentioned it, open-source is one of the best things about OBS. Any bugs or glitches get resolved pretty quickly because so many people can review the code and developers can create plugins any time they want to.¬†

#### Simple Interface

It might not be the sleekest interface in the world but when you open OBS Studio, you can basically get to everything you need in one or two easy clicks. In addition, the preview screen makes it easy to see what changes you‚Äôre making to the broadcast, and changing scenes or turning off sources can be done just as fast.¬†

#### Options for Settings

One thing that you‚Äôre going to constantly be doing in your broadcasting is changing settings. Depending on how good (or bad) your computer is, affects how your broadcast or stream will be run. OBS makes it easy to change things like Resolution, Bit Rate, FPS, and more.¬†

#### Low CPU Usage

Whether you‚Äôre streaming games, broadcasting for work, or just chatting online using OBS, one important thing is to make sure your broadcasting software isn‚Äôt using a lot of your CPU capacity.

OBS uses a lot less of your CPU than platforms like Streamlabs which makes you able to do other things like gaming or running other programs much more smoother.¬†

### OBS Studio Cons

#### No Alerts Integration

If you‚Äôre broadcasting to a platform like Twitch or YouTube, one thing streamers do is have an alert that comes up when someone follows, subscribes, or donates.

OBS doesn‚Äôt have a way for you to do this just with this platform, so you‚Äôd have to use Streamlabs or Streamelements to make this happen although the process is straightforward.¬†

#### Not Beginner Friendly

Now, we mentioned that the interface is simple to use but if you are a novice in technical things, OBS doesn‚Äôt have the easiest path to understanding how to use the software.¬†

#### Missing Some Bells and Whistles

Besides the alerts integration, OBS doesn‚Äôt have an internal plugin or app for things like integrated chats, event queues, and other things that make streams stand out. Just like with alerts though, you can use something like Streamlabs to add these to OBS.¬†

### OBS Pricing

OBS Studio is 100% free and every feature possible is available at the free level. In addition, some plugins or apps can be used in OBS that you would need to pay for but aren‚Äôt necessary at all. Basically, everything you need to run a stream can be done for free using OBS Studio.

## [Streamlabs OBS](https://serp.ly/streamlabs/)

[Streamlabs OBS](https://serp.ly/streamlabs/), also known as SLOBS, was released as an easy-to-use beginner-friendly streaming platform. It basically takes everything you need from OBS Studio and puts it in a smoother user interface and has extra apps and plugins (both free and paid) to allow you to add on to your streaming or broadcasting experience.¬†

You can add twitch overlays, multiple webcams, audio sources, and games and displays, all with a few easy clicks. Most people can get set up and stream in less than an hour.¬†

### Streamlabs OBS Pros

#### Streamlabs Cloudbot

Every streamer needs a bot to use commands, ban viewers if needed, thank people for following, and more. Streamlabs gives you moderation tools and commands, along with letting you run polls, play games with your chat, and allow chat to do things like heists.¬†

#### Automated Setup

Right when you install Streamlabs OBS, it walks you through everything you need to be able to broadcast within the first 15 minutes. Then, SLOBS runs tests to determine your bandwidth and CPU capabilities and gives you settings that they recommend for your stream based on your equipment.¬†

#### Design Options

One of the reasons most people pick SLOBS over OBS Studio is the capabilities you can have in designing the stream the way you want to. Streamlabs has webcam overlays, themes, widgets, and plugins that allow you to do everything from creating a border around your webcam and game to transitions between scenes and intermission screens.¬†

#### Alert Integration

When someone follows or subscribes to your stream, you want to thank them. However, as Streamlabs has, you can‚Äôt do that without an alert integration on platforms like OBS.

You can use SLOBS default alerts or they have free animations and sounds that you can use. You can also import your own gifs or pictures to use.¬†

#### Other Free Widgets and Plugins

Besides the plugins we‚Äôve already mentioned, you have other widgets and apps that you can use like putting your chatbox on your screen, rotating a sponsor banner, media shares to pop up videos on stream that your chat wants to see, and more.¬†

You can also add follower, subscription, or donation goals to incentivize viewers to support you along your journey.¬†

#### Streamlabs Prime

Streamlabs Prime can be a section all by itself and we will go through it more below but this is when we‚Äôre entering parts of Streamlabs where you have to pay. We‚Äôll go over the pricing below but with the paid version, you get access to premium animated overlays, additional apps, your own custom merch store, sponsorships, and more.¬†

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zg6CWfJkRnl3XkkE3urM0qfuMYqYsTptfUe73xBqpHFuGMLVtgPUj00WQy5heujxoKs6Xf-IahM9rjrzT9efYyGWYvEVFOxzS7797ida1IWR2axlS5TORSz6K6oSgIuHtVtH5anDDbmcuPQZ1C1g2UjYE7W_aKZwXtJYDWFfHaz5cHeJuEyqPiCgWfKY)

#### Multi-Stream Integration

One other thing you get access to if you have prime is the ability to Multistream. This means that you can be live on Twitch, YouTube, and Facebook simultaneously, for example. All three chats will come through your chat box as one and this helps you gain exposure on three platforms and future-proof your account in case anything happens.¬†

### Streamlabs OBS Cons

#### CPU Intensive

Probably the biggest knock that anyone can have on Streamlabs is how much CPU usage it uses on your computer. If you have a budget-level computer, this might cause an issue for you and even if you have a modest computer, using SLOBS and playing some of the most CPU-heavy games might cause lag as well. In addition, because of all the extra apps and plugins, Streamlabs can drag your game, stream, and CPU all down.¬†

#### Features Behind Paywall

Obviously, Streamlabs has to make money somehow, but leaving things like the multistream functionality and animated overlays behind paywalls can be seen as a negative if you are looking not to spend money.¬†

### Streamlabs OBS Pricing¬†

If you want to use Streamlabs OBS and get online to stream on any of your preferred streaming platforms, that is 100% free to do with SLOBS. You get the broadcasting software along with their free widgets, apps, and themes/overlays.¬†

Now, if you want to upgrade to the Streamlabs Prime plan, you can sign up with an annual plan, quarterly plan, or monthly plan.¬†

- Annual Plan ‚Äì $149/year

- Quarterly Plan ‚Äì $45 every three months or $180 for the year.¬†

- Monthly Plan ‚Äì $19/month or $228 for the year

If you want to get the equivalent of OBS Studio in the Streamlabs version, you don‚Äôt have to pay anything to get that. Instead, you get everything that comes with the free package if you install SLOBS and go through the fast setup and you‚Äôre ready to go.¬†

## What Is Broadcasting Software?¬†

Broadcasting software allows streamers or other parties to encode and broadcast their stream out to different streaming platforms. The software will allow you to set up how the stream will look and function, what video or game would be on the screen along with the audio playing.¬†

## Why Do Streamers Need Broadcasting Software?

If someone wants to stream onto popular streaming platforms, you have to use broadcasting software. Without one, you would have no way of recording and streaming the video and audio from your computer to other people‚Äôs devices.¬†

## Can You Use Streamlabs with OBS?

Streamlabs has an integration that works with OBS Studio. You can use Streamlabs Alerts and other widgets like the Chat Box and Event Queues. Many streamers do this to save on CPU with OBS open and Streamlabs only operating when alerts go off.¬†¬†

## Does Streamlabs OBS Cost Money?

Streamlabs OBS is 100% free. They have a premium version where you can use their premium themes, premium apps and plugins, and more. All of the software that you need to start streaming or broadcasting is available for free, though.¬†

## What Do You Get with Streamlabs Prime?

When it comes to upgrading, here is everything you get with Streamlabs Prime.¬†

### Pro Themes

Customize your stream with the best overlays, graphics, and themes that work on Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, and more.

### Multi-Stream

Stream to multiple platforms at the same time. For example, you can stream to Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, and more at once to expand your reach and grow.¬†

### 40+ Apps

### Custom Tip Page

When viewers want to donate money, you send them to a customized page to entice people to support you more.¬†

### Custom Merch Store

Let your viewers shop directly from your website. They take care of the printing, shipping, and support.¬†

### Custom Cloudbot

Take your cloudbot to the next level with a custom bot name.¬†

## Can You Stream To Multiple Platforms With Streamlabs OBS?

Yes. If you have Streamlabs Prime, you can multi-stream to Twitch, Facebook, and YouTube all at the same time. All you need to do is link each account to your Streamlabs OBS and then tell the program to make you go live on each of these platforms when you start streaming.¬†

## [Streamlabs](https://serp.ly/streamlabs/) vs.[OBS Studio](https://serp.ly/obs/): Which Is Better?¬†

There is no perfect answer to which is better for every potential streamer. The answer for you can change depending on if you have a budget or high-end computer, or if you are technically inclined, or more of a novice.¬†

It can also influence your decision based on whether you already have an overlay and theme or if you need one and prefer not to spend any money at all or are willing to spend money to grow your reach.¬†
