In 2015, over 70% of businesses multiplied their content output tenfold.

The global economy keeps growing, and the need for graphic design services has been increasing ever since, with the entire industry valued at a whopping $15 billion.

This number is only going to go upward. With most businesses scrambling to embrace a virtual persona to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, demand has been higher than ever.

Frustratingly, though, it‚Äôs not feasible for most businesses to outsource digital agencies or hire freelance graphic designers.

If you want to cut down on costs and learn their work yourself, you can ‚Äì but for the 90% of the world‚Äôs creative professionals who use Adobe Photoshop, the journey to proficient graphic designership is a slightly steep learning curve. The license is pretty expensive, too.

Enter [Canva](https://serp.ly/canva). Or Crello. They‚Äôre both great. But what are they? And which one‚Äôs better?

Follow this extensive Crello vs.Canva guide to find out which online graphic design platform is best for you.

## What Is Canva?

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/vYVzkcP6J9V6TA4iT1ATipjVX5lDzELSS5T9MNHMAkrXHr6RaXIPgarlOHunvrqxcPtVZyAAtGmTipJrNkLUS2Yw0RS_vw_afW2uvJIWwLe4s1E3-PX6LSLnJhjVzdIcT5LnIHSM4uGpd2EO1NiqetZd0hI-ThsXz28_TdCzdAioQ47t94lmJTYdOE4s)

[Canva](https://serp.ly/canva) is a creative online design tool that‚Äôs been around since 2012 and has a staggering 55 million monthly users. It works on a freemium model that has experienced designers and newbies alike flocking to use it.

Canva is very easy to navigate, and even its free version offers a wide variety of templates that you can put to good use. Its drag-and-drop interface will have you churning out designs in a matter of minutes and, with a little bit of practice, your content will have an aesthetic, professional designer feel to it.

## What Is Crello?

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3OT4iS-vDCMvTAVyM8TPeefysqk2aYzyBJCD_D4A51lqFc4Nu5qdsk34X-4zQDU2vmDOT8gBjdWaLAcHSJfVQP0evJ18O9IH2DHqq44fztu2Xd6NBhBuiRumSdGqbiXRE1plAHtS2lc5ZnK6QzlrYu_52X00K4mcc3xjhhMWLsPuMEea7g5AOFNUdV5I)

[Crello](https://devinschumacher.com/review/crello) is the new kid on the block. Launched in 2018, it has over two million users worldwide and is responsible for over 3000 designs every day. It may seem like a measly number in front of Canva‚Äôs 400 million designs to date (and counting), but don‚Äôt be fooled.

Crello and Canva share many of the same features and both have an intuitive interface that makes the user experience pleasing and extremely easy to use. In addition, Crello boasts a library of over 100 million high-quality images on top of 500,000 premium free photos.

It‚Äôs a fair bit cheaper, too, so it may be a more attractive option to those just starting.

## Pricing

### [Canva](https://serp.ly/canva/)

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-M8K6IJy4G73ghokVnp0s9LDsqtJFUAtpNIKjcS7NX2pMITNIJTWAbHtOcgp4ATsKQu4YSYgsb-hQNXk_1KEPBCSDVOdCZI6WsbdG44tLTav47cagFzSUlwjtnEZkO4Hie4h4MLH324X45vSyA8s5rowOaNnaxbE6NZOnWD8gRHlVBkfzY8Q0qEWzsC1)

Canva has a free plan Canva Free, which is good enough for most people‚Äôs needs. In addition, it has about 50,000 graphic design templates which will allow you to create designs for most of your needs and is probably the most thing for new designers who are just starting.

However, if you‚Äôre looking to bump up to Canva Pro, which costs $12.99 per month, you‚Äôll upgrade to a whole bunch of new premium features (which we‚Äôll talk about a bit later).

If that‚Äôs not enough for you, Canva Enterprise is available for $30 a month with the whole package of design tools and third-party integrations.

### Crello

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/GKY0Tsv8Cot8Z_iGnBA1ml34ISz_oj1pXAANWDYKhaapswGpRGchtVFsSsB8KVLWefMfEd1x_Zass04JVUNEkwDL9qo1vzGH_4cxt_tSffHwXPB4t4U80qS8UvIr8_hoj8ymIEWhaSdcb_8pL72aI7ZJ0eGC6p-Yhg3lm1btHipvAoNY83IIWswNRzse)

Crello‚Äôs monthly pricing comes in at $7.99 per month. So it‚Äôs definitely cheaper, but while both Crello and Canva share many of the same design elements, Crello only has 25,000 design templates to choose from.

Of course, this is plenty to work with 25,000 free templates are no joke, but Canva lets you choose from double that amount, and having options is always a good thing.

It‚Äôs worth keeping in mind that Canva offers a 7-day free trial, so you can try Canva Pro out before deciding whether you want to upgrade. Crello also entertains a free trial for its Pro version, which is new.

Crello offers no such ‚ÄúEnterprise‚Äù plan, either. So, while both online graphic design tools offer powerful free plans and provide very similar features, Canva slightly edges it for us, even if it‚Äôs a little bit pricier.

While you may feel the Canva Enterprise‚Äôs price might make a significant difference to your wallet, Canva Pro‚Äôs $12.99 price tag lets you create stunning designs that are well worth the cost.

## Who Is It For?

### [Canva](https://serp.ly/canva/)

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/l_NsKF7zv0U5kvkVKs0CIyIHVtXfm6jgYeT0npIxZN8m2HZ9ygZ8Mp3uiTi7hEU2kJpGPBrXGipzrzdVL4srG8sUozrZumA3QpEHhbpQn5psg628jTY0u018EC9FyaO3xdYEEktHwPa4XBNsa9awXXBus3rCEdKsj74wNUgg-BmMrJimRBEO9HnKOLUZ)

Canva is an extremely versatile online tool that can be used by bloggers, small business owners, students, teachers ‚Äì anybody, really. The list goes on.

Whether you need it to make a presentation for a class, or if you‚Äôre a freelancer using it for a part-time gig, Canva offers a wide array of features that suit everyone ‚Äì free plan, Canva Pro, or Canva Enterprise.

In fact, some Fortune 500 companies are known to use Canva templates for their graphic designs.¬†

As a result, social media managers‚Äô lives have been made much easier and the best part is if you don‚Äôt have a social media manager, you can be your own. That‚Äôs the beauty of new-age online graphic design software.

### Crello

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/eBsfUWykwlPI6LKY4l-Z4MKnBl2YGEKzZeYMwuc3nd9WV6xwEeRzncQI0TLgj_gTUeAB_w5WAG0plvW_jfr32Zeq2rCwyFOaJIAjCZJHPkPJANSBNtSgI0ovyt0fiimPwqxAw-VIDsa63_nmPhDQeq9Nc_LBqvGxmNXtFI9Sj1RhjirTeiRdvIeE6PJd)

Whether you opt for the free Crello plan or Crello Pro, Canva and Crello appeal to much of the same demographic and are used at various levels through the business ‚Äì and design ‚Äì hierarchy.

Crello offers attractive plans to create stunning graphics if you are really tight on a budget.

Its user interface isn‚Äôt any more complicated than Canva‚Äôs, and with a little practice, the visual content you put out will be entirely up to you, regardless of who you are and which design tool you choose to use.

If you‚Äôre happy with the 25,000 Crello templates and you don‚Äôt mind the free version, then even the lowest-tier option here can yield great results. It‚Äôs plenty powerful anyway.

## Features: Canva Vs Crello (Free Plans)

Firstly, let‚Äôs get into what Canva and Crello offer in terms of their Free and Pro plans, and then we‚Äôll dive a little deeper from there.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JNPHlRneALE7BYRuBRGlQTTWMLFgKinGr2s8PpiDUN0AsHnZQ06Rhe8o9-E0Aj5yLR1hQ0yse6aXUceQOhtDAU84a5xjPOnqs2wz4xxtwNBg_wpWZ_X0jTLVICOpPmMhRoLmyqKJWgwRQpsseul8YHNbZRiZl0tqTBasFL7iEuSKcewKzL1PN4nj_1-n)

### Photos

#### Canva

To start off with, you get over 200,000+ free images with Canva to use for your photo editing and social media graphics. There are quite a few handy editing options in the image converter as well.

Premium images (of which 75 million and above) will cost you $1 a pop if you don‚Äôt have the Pro plan.

#### Crello

Crello gives you access to a huge library of 650k free stock images that you can use in your image editing and graphic designs.

Crello‚Äôs parent company, Depositphotos, blows Canva out of the water with its premium image library of over 180 million stock images if you have the Pro plan. An image here is $0.99 apiece if you don‚Äôt have a Pro account.

### Videos

#### Canva

Canva gives you a collection of 13,000 free videos on the Free plan. They‚Äôre high-quality stock videos that cover a wide variety of themes.

#### Crello

Crello more than doubles Canva‚Äôs video library, with a vast collection of 32,000 videos. All for free.

### Templates

#### Canva

Creating designs is really easy with Canva due to its numerous readymade template categories. You can create graphics for your social media platforms with the 250,000+ saved templates available. It‚Äôs amazing how much you get with a free account.

#### Crello

Although the design element isn‚Äôt necessarily lacking, Crello does fall slightly short with only 30,000 free templates.

There‚Äôs more than enough to work your way through with, but a few more options would have been nice.

### Animation Styles

#### Canva

If you‚Äôre into video editing, Canva‚Äôs neat array of animations with graphic elements lets you bolster your designs through its six different animation styles.

The ever-so-simple drag-and-drop editor lets you add motion and movement to different design elements which take simple designs and makes them stunning designs.

#### Crello

Video editing can be done with Crello too, albeit you‚Äôll have two fewer animation styles to choose from (four).

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/vvJYRmXYc1pRCQ2rqaAGopog0rBiSzhvzkjbKOSwNqLE2xbjwyWzN_AJywNWCjT_8xFfp3OwEMNhS39r93tv6XoGh7oRBMoLY59kIH8S1GJ-y_7M3t086GL6r-RUaScbME8GmYggUcMQbjrUr0fXgYc_Zk5p8WP2dVeActHdLV4FJ7arBM4p7VD2KDWA)

### Fonts

#### Canva

Canva‚Äôs free plan has more fonts than you‚Äôll ever need.

However, if you have any of your own fonts that you want to upload, you‚Äôll have to do that by adding custom fonts to the Brand Kit option via a Pro subscription.

#### Crello

Crello has no such limitations when it comes to fonts.

Even on the Free plan, you can upload your own custom fonts without paying a single penny.

### Resizing

#### Canva

Alas, if you want to resize designs, you‚Äôll need a Canva Pro account.

However, a quick little hack you can use is to open up a new design in the dimensions you want, and then copy the design elements from your original design to your new tab.

You‚Äôll have to organize each design element as per your preferred arrangement, but that‚Äôs one way to work around it if you aren‚Äôt willing to go Pro.

#### Crello

Crello strikes again!

It doesn‚Äôt matter what format you‚Äôre working on, or if you‚Äôre even working through the mobile app ‚Äì yes, these lovely design tools have mobile versions ‚Äì because you can easily resize designs to your liking with Crello‚Äôs free plan.

### Transparent Backgrounds

#### Canva

If you have your own logo or personal branding of any sort, this tool will come in handy.

Sadly, this is yet another Canva Pro feature that lets you download a PNG of any element you want with a transparent background.

#### Crello

Crello does allow you to download images off its Free version with a transparent background however, there‚Äôs a catch.

You can only use it on designs that have a white background. Otherwise, you‚Äôll have to go for Crello Pro.

### Storage

#### Canva

A free account on Canva gives you access to 5 GB of cloud storage for all your content.

#### Crello

The exact limit on Crello‚Äôs free plan is unknown, but there is a storage limit.

You‚Äôll need the Pro plans for Canva and Crello if you want at least 100 GB of storage, if not unlimited storage.

### Folders

#### Canva

With Canva Free, you can create up to two folders to organize your work.

#### Crello

Crello allows you to create as many folders as you want to help you keep your designs organized.

It is convenient if you need to work with social media designs and need designs of different dimensions for different social media platforms.

### Downloads

#### Canva

Arguably, one of Canva‚Äôs most attractive features is the ability to have unlimited downloads.

You can download as many designs as you like with a free Canva account, no matter the format.

#### Crello

Unfortunately, this feature is a real let-off for some people when it comes to Crello.

Crello and Canva have both been fairly matched until now when it comes to the free Crello vs.Canva battle.

However, the fact that you can only download five free designs per month is slightly disappointing.

### Teams And Collaboration

#### Canva

The team collaboration option is a standout feature of Canva. It really is quite superb.

Even with the freebie, you can create up to 20 teams and ‚Äì get this ‚Äì have 3000 members per team.

You can even assign roles if you have a social media team, like an Administrator or a Member, and invite team members to view or edit designs.

You and your team members can even leave comments on designs in and you can tag each other to let each other know if you have any feedback on ongoing designs.

#### Crello

If you want team collaboration for social media or any other work that you might have, the Canva vs.Crello debate could end for you here.

Crello doesn‚Äôt offer any team collaborations or team management without its Pro version, and even then, you‚Äôre limited to just 10 members per team.

### Mobile Applications

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QBoBJU9REkw2Wp8IbTbbrsebmzyRI4C4bT__scD6Ro_zQpe6VSVq-xsfk8lLSH7HGStkaEdRwdm-Imu2WCJQTBmaTOuqp1njnysr7Ah5erO1-RN6fhdJZxedj9BX6VoulREAFgEuioD-U2tLJBVj6YQ4p5LXjirnhQNC6Z6pfN_-12_B66ygT3rpYSeQ)

Fear not, for you won‚Äôt have to download shady third-party apps to make designs if you‚Äôre on the go.

Canva and Crello both have their own proprietary smartphone apps which you can find on your operating system of choice.

They‚Äôre both clean, intuitive interfaces on mobile and you should get by perfectly fine if you need to make a few minimal tweaks here and there.

### Customer Support

Both tools offer chat-based support if you need to get around any minor inconveniences while using either software.

However, if you need some extra help, the customer support team for both companies is superb, although Crello seems to get back to you a tad quicker if you‚Äôre running a tight deadline on design submissions.

## Final Thoughts

As you can see, Crello struggles to compete with the sheer number of features that Canva offers. Canva is the industry giant for a reason, with some features simply too good to ignore.

Even though Canva is slightly more expensive than Crello, the benefits far outweigh Crello‚Äôs limitations.

For most people, from freelancers to small business owners to full-fledged enterprises, Canva offers pricing and features at all levels which will satisfy most users.

While Crello‚Äôs animation features are impressive and beat Canva in some departments, Canva‚Äôs pro features like the content planner, vector downloading, team collaboration, and brand kit keep it at the top of the ladder when it comes to online graphic design tools.
