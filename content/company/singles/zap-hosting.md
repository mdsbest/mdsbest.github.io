As I went to [ZAP-hosting.com](https://serp.ly/zap-hosting) , I was greeted by this page. Here, you can see the hosting services that they offered and a registration form. I registered an account and then signed up for a web hosting plan for only $4.56 per month to understand how ZAP hosting works. I also noticed that there are two ways of settling your account, either prepaid or contract. Prepaid accounts will expire if not paid on time. You don't need to give any bank or account details.

Contracts will automatically be renewed, and you have to provide account and billing details.

For this review, I chose Webspace Large for my hosting packet and a monthly billing period. You can also choose to have access to your DDos protection overview or not. For this review, I decide not to have access.
