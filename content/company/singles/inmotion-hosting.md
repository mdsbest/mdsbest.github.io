## Getting Started With InMotion Hosting

To get started, you need to go to the [InMotion Hosting](https://serp.ly/inmotion) website.

![inmotion hosting homepage](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xqZNlYVW3QasaDs177VujMcpWtltgqgelIhlYM8gVP7IIvNd1tQPsmDflO5IKkYJ34u_UPzj58I76SMoutXPCRC8hnYpvkhgUGI96iLUTpCyxecPJut4s22btZ2mSGnwdj4lFi8j6E_Up4IopNutrOs)

On the homepage, you'll find a banner advertising their current promotions, as well as a list of the various plans they provide, including Shared Hosting plans, WordPress Hosting, VPS Hosting, and Dedicated Server Hosting solutions.

When you first attempt to sign up for the service, InMotion will redirect you to this page. Shared Hosting - cPanel shared Hosting overview and plan information

![inmotion hosting shared hosting plans](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/59p7S6ahBYYOh7g9S-06X7GYomV6RYI9DCseosjDXCyaRbwTHowzgavzTk_oSPfCGnl8xxc-I7bhkvC0HtlCE5CCA83N_7ABRM6aIHs1-haBCvB5d6nWeJz15O6utiFoh_nXl_AIzk4uH4RA0bR-5sY)

Here, you will have three options to choose from - Launch, Power, and Pro. Shared hosting plans have their own distinct set of features for each option you choose.

This is similar to what other hosting companies show as well. WordPress Hosting - High-performance and reliable Hosting plans for WordPress websites

![inmotion hosting dedicated servers plans](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/u9zNddVqWJpxVI6OSBNksu2ydZgwR4sLFl_Sg-bTxgJb-M_s8LvP_iR8FWHdV5Azf1wMV4XgwEwC1la4Od9-oNDsjtkTjMPLYuPYPkqOGoF8gtj7iV260ig2wWPqdJEw6WeJJv0avvzB-FQIwPB3U_U)

Here, you'll have four plans to choose from; each plan indicates how many Gigabytes it comes with: 2GB, 4GB, 6GB, and 8GB of RAM. Things may become a little complex here but you shouldn't have too many problems if you know what you need and want.

Reseller Hosting - Start your own web hosting firm, or supplement your development or design services with your own branded web hosting services.

![InMotion Hosting reseller hosting plans](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/6NHNaP9TBDg7ErSVLt0guyyhDjuyL1IUYLPJ1wFW78UInVY5Zpywn3cHJTKYRSoadSZKYjJ1-0q-ySdAfJ4JBLMrUmj6C_4MuUwF1EBG2uixvEd2-Q4sifGAsVIrobrotV8IrKGSXCSsCjsbOWzG09c)

For this review, I opted for the Shared Hosting Launch plan, which offers a free domain, a free domain name and SSL, 50GB SSD Storage, two websites, unlimited bandwidth, ten email addresses, a security suite, and marketing tools. Be reminded that if you choose the cheapest plan available to test it out, this review is perfect for you.

Don't worry though; InMotion Hosting's plans come with a 90-day money-back guarantee (in case you opt for the 2-year plan) if you change your mind.

![Shared hosting launch plan](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tnQISi9LUUXc6SYQPFV6CKTXv-qsBvvlUwmLA6-pEcthRfqAgfLI1sjiwFohq2UORr5UYekMnKCELqtGWMawfytO8qTSFJF_FaGM_i0xB6aOJkaL_Gh-FIRHDcMemdv07LQBqNqehf8iUywyiGJZHzo)

By clicking Add to Cart you will be redirected to this page where you can customize your payment plan by month, year, or every 2 years.

![Screenshot of cart](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/U8kKBnqUBo7oNkL_IXmZeZdAtyOczY89FvjeQWykCjviqfjj0q-n6ZLKfIY8H0waQ0LS0PbDCdAxH0-hWAanpl90Rz1HVcXgKeT2o8rjjtd0yuc8ZX4kPzL5W8TZuUOv_Q1AJkldMjBHuSeARY6YAlk)

You can also add various installers that InMotion offers at an additional price for your chosen plan. In my case, I decided to go with the 2-year subscription which costs $5.99 a month. After that, click continue.

![Additional installer options](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/v7rh7BsQcd-_HUUGh6Rg10dEELfS8LzahpfF0yBuwaJBXl-eu6dTTJ2ON5x8GSmrKAjMjk8a0o4bwbwB0vT3l1i_X0cIPrLoXmmgpgzjQeLcTTqq-dnMCRvKFOSGY1CHUS0xIhopZ7xfPRTvMg3Tlt8)

You will then be redirected to the page where you can set up your domain or if you already have an existing domain, you can transfer it here as well.

![Initial domain setup](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_0fUqKNlWO_wMpUps4Ay5mZF6ZRyhmMWRrPR7nlon_C9SjPRxCasKZtRTb2Eek6S6fFV9CnSUeEV9vlPHSDut8wEL2EQFduuZvKKj07lFjIWye5OJwbWnsn0KOCU2YD4z0YBk0nz3UT8hUbMEpCKwuI)

After you have registered your domain click continue again. By doing this you will proceed to the Billings tab where you put in details about your account, billing, and payment information.

![Initial billing information setup](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Xt6PVHJ1wzjQSG5IyEUL8MtMywXaXJ3MWDnksb6_-dW_aZFK7Y7XXmvknqcWAvLsYWFs3MQjZSfmeR51hf_sWCSxOaL1PscPaDvD28pHzAgt6ekN5p8BdvpvtdwtirhT8lU1X__KjfLv9J0PYQL77nM)

After typing in your account details, you'll find the payment method tab where you write your payment information. You can choose from paying with a credit or debit card, via Paypal, or through a US Purchase Order or Check. That's all there is, so you'll be good to go.

You should receive an email confirming that the payment was successful, together with the login information to access your Account Management Panel (AMP).

![InMotion Hosting welcome email with instructions](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/HkthSeXrSIi4_o8Ir9jWPFqLoPYBDlH4okVktZzyz0r0kniQ16ITGPqZGj0G_PBwaNCPayQIM9RK-NUvhlTVjmQ8DOKUhNrx-2LFaJDWHIpKn7x93ZAo8ZY8Zm3F6e-h9BLBxoyLbjYKf4WS2_r9ynA)

Here, you will be provided with a temporary login password, and the first thing you want to do is change that for security purposes.

## Using and Managing Your Website on InMotion Hosting

When I clicked the Login button, InMotion redirected me to this page.

![Account Management Panel login page](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Kda7DJt1zay0uPcsaiML53kqu1KC4F0Zh1IelHrwecDuY0OC_B-iv3yE3EmQBCsF-Ja56NevDdnljP3kOTjuqXab7rmm7q2jF1vn5gUoJJN7MZ55gXwPmxW1qNud8dmuESZnj-CO61POBGZN7ViQkkU)

Account Management Panel login page

Here, you will input the email you used to create your InMotion account and your password; you can find this in the confirmation email InMotion hosting sent you.

## Account Management Panel (AMP)

![Account Management Panel](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/QXsZ5Dy8FcFg7BfdWFMQcO--hKg5ZxvRds5zPmXxII9__ctIaydX7zIayCFwkxyv0tUIJVJzhV4AMbbFIq6RhTl8Xw5vHE8YLd1oap4jfTb4ut4NpJepu6uIvjEwFDBhWyeVmm7p0u12OCld-1YO13A)

Account Management Panel

Your InMotion Hosting AMP Dashboard looks like this. AMP is for account management in terms of billing, domain names, security, feedback, support tickets, and upgrades.

## InMotion Hosting CPanel

### What is cPanel?

cPanel is a Linux-based control panel that provides users with a dashboard to manage various elements on their website. It is among the most popular control panels used to make websites run efficiently. It's easy to learn and navigate as well.

cPanel also lets you manage and customize your InMotion hosting account. Here, you will be able to create new email accounts, new passwords, create new domains, and much more.

![InMotion Hosting cPanel screenshot](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/3OtK9UvS0ySOdXwODxR_0ynEVTkbhty_CyUoT4Sy-sOBIA3rCxXHAy_S3Od0KBFpIHw1dqauf6jV5PGgax9gO_MJm_pOEYIlRXfH-YLqiiNvSlh_XfqbhDlZWlp7e2WkGhgCzKnHr0Teu1P0DK9_R-Y)

To gain access to your cPanel Interface, click the cPanel button on your AMP. This will redirect you to your cPanel account and it will log you in automatically. This shows you the features of cPanel that you have control over.

Email

Email Accounts Access to an email server is included in the InMotion hosting plan. You can set up email accounts with your website's domain name, use a free web-based email client, or use the email client of your preference. To gain access, click on Email Accounts.

![cPanel Email options](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/vQhh0eE8AHhQ1WNslopyJQMiwQNWiAE8WKgtxEY9o7dXegu02H6JGcgldpJU_iCoAeE5D2FJkAjyFTIiu5kAjZnA8K4NPnijEoPc0qFpmNLaIstY5QYz2fDwEfX0H4TR9r14jbxTs2gixca30vxiBXA)

You will then see your email accounts page after clicking on the Email Accounts tab. Your pre-existing emails will be listed here; after that, click create.

![Email accounts section](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cNWVyzaHbHSEQUVd6emU5mY6Ywp_NUIfa0Jwpu-QswFADzsXauE1D-7AUPXk8Gi5SO7uAFGlfJcfzRm_-wjAge_pY4b9V6ZXTGe5ZEs6Z9tDYHy76B-HYGA1NU5llV1_AzGI2IOfvB8nGvSIx3Fq4hc)

Email accounts section

### Domains

You may add new domains to your account, set up parked domains, establish subdomains, set up redirects, and much more in the Domains section of the cPanel. Before you can configure the cPanel, you must first have a domain registered and pointed to your server. Otherwise, merely adding it to the cPanel will be ineffective.

It is simple to add another domain in cPanel, but the process can be intimidating the first time, especially if you've never done it before. In general, you'll need to register the new domain, point it to the appropriate nameservers, and then add the domain to the cPanel so it can be recognized.

### File Management

You can backup your cPanel account, access and modify files stored in your account, analyze disk usage, create, and manage FTP accounts via the Files section of the cPanel. File Manager The cPanel File Manager lets you control your website via HTTP, just like a web browser, rather than an FTP application.

![cPanel file manager](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/FNAz6WjBPlT4yEH9YU6Wtqan4ykmg8ld_4LNiOZZZ-5T-RlKrclOgwhvXA3gCKv7_jq5ceisq2EIvpQ3QVXE_CCMtHg09xTD9qUJXNWuq3pd83UiMlB1yV-mh7YhE7zF8mni8cOyGMRiMIXfw4N87pg)

This is pretty straightforward. The File Manager, as the name implies, is where you can manage files. Here, you can move, edit, upload, modify, delete, and restore said files. Backup and Backup Wizard You can use the Backup interface to download and save files, databases, forwarders, and filters to a backup file. If you are new to cPanel or file backups, it's better to use the Backup Wizard interface instead.

![cPanel files options including Backup Wizard](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Btv1wReEKHrZNzMbfi9cKq3C8TK5CivJPLYiKOwxj6NMhhSceEIsZhzLh3qxWFlsLF4m4Zk2a9gMV3eXluRhMa_V-4zylQH3o9UJ28E0zhrXQ-IeMgE2ByTyyl-kH74YxxUR5o5Mfo7z-i23CNuXPe0)

Disk Usage The overall disk space used on your account includes all data, including website files, MySQL databases, and email messages. When you log in to the cPanel, you will see a summary of disk space consumption on the right side.

![Disk usage screen](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/vSkVMIEor8wD6dlWK4BLa8lP82mwYPdjadSrl-VJzhYu8h7TClA2Lbmz4aSSRbMPCKfFjQwDo0AfICxlGIULXV0l1XQsCh_XjpqzVAPRzBu5UhXyd4-UE5ODJzV0YSAEL1j6nrSnzRRTwNyfk9uR-n4)

FTP Accounts and FTP Connections

![FTP accounts screen](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/legwBqu74SId5t9J8-nGjrYygpE-GmFf5K-HNBwUsX-s7_OppC7rbu3Q8CK5fMgTNn0S-_4LjmhuaepP_hn93l7w1pnKsPu_70NlaDCUwawshjCW2zltiYi8g-7hye0oamB36C5zAvG1TY29UPRqqv4)

You may create and manage FTP accounts using the cPanel FTP Accounts feature. You can specify which directories the FTP account has access to, as well as change its limits. On the other hand, FTP Connections display information about current FTP server connections and allow you to control such connections.

### Databases

MySQL Database To control MySQL databases and users, use the MySQL Databases tool. You can manage user database permissions and add, modify, or delete databases and users. phpMyAdmin

![phpMyAdmin main screen](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Ga831Q81UBWbHF6o5YnZ0pfOoVQzazgws5xI-pVSPLGLOz-9EmJbWx_ngaNR6G0nwBnjLEwnamOLama6oz-HseFjWLOLYj4SfMiMh7nSWBohWVraYbPkspq0eOkAGK9h9_ZCKIR4YroAVZuV5PU4KQs)

You must first build a database before you can manage this in phpMyAdmin. phpMyAdmin allows you to control all parts of your database's structure and data. You can create and delete tables, import and export data, run SQL queries, repair tables, and more.

### Metrics

Keeping track of various statistics for your website is critical for business and marketing. In the Metrics area, you can view a range of statistics, track errors, and monitor bandwidth usage.

This section allows you to narrow down where the traffic is coming from, how many visitors you have, and which parts of your site are visited. Error is another handy feature in the Metrics section; without having to log in via SSH, you may examine your account's problems here for troubleshooting.

### Security

One of the most crucial things you should do is keep your website secure. The tools in this category allow you to limit SSH access, ban IP addresses, and prevent the hotlinking of photos. This is also where you manage your website's security certificates.

### Software

The software category is where you can expand the capabilities of the website. There are two crucial tools provided here to assist in configuring the PHP on your website. MultiPHP Manager allows you to specify which version of PHP is running on a given site.

The MultiPHP INI Editor allows you to make more detailed adjustments, enabling certain PHP options and changing variables. Softaculous makes installing popular website software such as WordPress and Drupal simple and easy, with only a few clicks.

Softaculous can be used to test out many sorts of software and to get started developing your WordPress sites. Many web hosts offer similar functionality but InMotion does a slightly better job than most.

### Advanced

This category is for actions that are not commonly performed but can be beneficial for customization. You will be able to use the Cron Jobs tool to generate custom Error Pages and schedule tasks.

### Preferences

The Preferences section is where you can customize several parts of the cPanel. For example, under Change Language you can change the display language, your Contact Information, and even reset your cPanel password.

### InMotion Hosting Website Builder

![InMotion Hosting WordPress website builder](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kUMLJSr4uvbvA6mE7qMJndbowwCzJ1ZOqhPAJUYiiOdS9lOB8jZrSQWhUu-68RJPVyeyJDLvv24-xuiPN-I0e1nAQsNVAqzYGcjw2vh4JdJAlmMd575u5f8TVzFRimFfRwAehYu12M5eeRYqB-Tl8O4)

InMotion Hosting also offers BoldGrid - a WordPress-based website builder.

### Softaculous Apps Installer

![Softaculous app installer](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/gB0OoknBd1dFwNUguUiP_V-PkztDQGlHGmDyn4SIX3Xk49ma5g7KeT9XN-9u-EBVXh_8NeBV6TgBHZH4l0u8vCx9vmM6BKXBvs_P1y2iYtATqPrkTdxUo28lMrPvgcYfNGWGvF5DKNBZcKiJxatmWT8)

InMotion Hosting comes with the Softaculous Apps Installer, where you can install, upgrade, and uninstall applications with ease to save some time; manually uploading installation files and configuring databases can be tedious and take long. With just a few clicks, you can install your next website, online shop, and a few other things as well.

### WordPress Themes

When you install WordPress using the Softaculous App Installer, it automatically comes with over 8,000 free themes to choose from in various styles and categories. But if you want to create a website from a blank canvas you can do that as well. InMotion Hosting offers WordPress dedicated hosting plans equipped with free SSD storage, NGINX Caching, PHP 7, PHP 8, and free CDN. Backup and malware protection also comes with the plan to make sure your website is secure from any vulnerabilities.

## InMotion Hosting Customer Support

[InMotion Hosting](https://serp.ly/inmotion-hosting) support is well-known for being responsive, experienced, and reliable. Of course, this InMotion Hosting review wouldn't be complete without it included. They could be reached by live chat, Skype, or, if you're feeling extra chatty, by their dedicated support phone line.

In this hosting review, I put it to the test. I clicked the message button located on the lower right side of the InMotion homepage. After that, I was redirected to a new window.

![Chat with sales screen (support screen)](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/0GxEsj6wUWj8Y8fMnNgyYPvThsTxd4qzD9kuT3kf0DPODAWdnIoOvmLSZwKd3H4Fw6TooyHHdXuQSFJO1A-csqsvlvcdXQiyJqBLtscS5iA163Q-GUVf7oC2kWZcu5WtGr_fvnFe-RRJeknq5kdqsok)

Miguel offered me a WordPress Hosting plan about which he was very knowledgeable and helpful. He provided me with a quotation and a link that I could use. Using the link, he claimed, would allow him to approve my account without the need for confirmation.

That was awesome! He even offered to send the quotation to my email and asked if I had any other questions. After I said "No, thanks.", the conversation ended. If you already signed up for a web hosting plan and need a technical support team to address your problems, you can select "technical support" from the Please select the most appropriate department drop-down menu.

I'd say their support team is good; it only takes a few seconds for them to answer, and they absolutely lived up to what others said - prompt and experienced!

### InMotion Hosting Server Speed

Server speed is essential to guaranteeing the integrity of your website. Websites that take ages to load are incredibly inconvenient for users.

![Screenshot of uptime and downtime](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/xFf09tHvgiuJVqkurkqvk4I_ztyVwLQ8LXCEvGTeW2K2zsQNJUfIQ-pgCtqOnO4eDC33xqM9rPAxqnkbJn5rXtGtWKkBPU257x-yycM9VkZLvtamirC6xiIT0aGG4o11t3RvZjRIC8DVRBwGDX5CFUg)

According to CyberNews' InMotion hosting review, the average loading time is 2.2 seconds, with a 99.84 percent uptime. In this instance, the uptime of your website running for a month would be inconsistent. This would imply a loss of revenue for an e-commerce business with high site traffic.

![Website performance overview](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/x1XTuJGNMUm32420kF_FLuGsu9PAg9UlYnPZ93Ms4mn0sHrqH29euxfKC1Sjc-jWlD4TzfYBOPMkyaXZmdzpdELxyqtz8YqOu6qszlCa9bGDOgycArfO12CN4hlc4i5-gl4WWgv4G9OBSWhDI9t2iB0)

CyberNews also used a stress test tool to test the stability of the website. With 50 users simultaneously, the response time was 260ms - pretty high. But surprisingly, the site stability was okay.

### Security and Backups

Your website should be equipped with a superb set of security features that will help keep your site safe from any unwanted breaches. Fortunately, InMotion Hosting is capable of doing so! You won't have to worry about hackers anymore, and you'll be able to focus more on your business or content.

Here is a list of the security and backup services offered by InMotion Hosting: Free SSL InMotion Hosting offers free SSL through cPanel signed by Comodo, one of the industry's most renowned SSL providers. 

You can establish "HTTPS" on your site only with a few clicks. This is important since Google, the largest search engine, labels websites without an SSL as "not secure." Hack Protection Patchman is a malware and vulnerability detection and patching application used by InMotion Hosting. 

It saves time and effort by preventing attacks from occurring. Patchman can even undo the modifications it has made automatically. If you have a business or reseller hosting plan, you can use this for free.

This is one of the best features of using InMotion hosting for your e-commerce website! DDoS Protection InMotion Hosting uses Corero to counteract potential threats and ensures a protected environment for your site. They offer best-in-class real-time DDoS attack protection, allowing you to keep your system up and running for all of your users.

Corero offers software and hardware solutions that can be modified up or down as necessary. The solution also delivers analytics and forensics based on monitored traffic data. Backups cPanel provides a built-in backup tool to assist you with creating free backups. 

Using this will create a compressed folder that you can download to your computer for storage. 

Note: cPanel does not allow backups to be stored in the file manager; therefore, you must keep them off the server. Additionally, InMotion Hosting offers an exclusive backup manager plugin for $2.00 a month. With it, you have 10GB of storage to create or restore partial and full backups and automate scheduled backups to trigger in specific situations if needed.

- The only hosting company that uses Skype - consumers more widely use Zoom

- You have to pay for the 1 and 2-year plans instantly as it does not offer a discounted month-to-month payment option

- Account confirmation and verification via phone call or live chat - for an InMotion customer living outside the US, this would be such a hassle

- Data centers only located in the US - if you and your audience are not from the US and you chose this hosting provider, there's a high chance that over time, it will run inconsistently

## Final Thoughts

Do I recommend InMotion Hosting? Yes and no. Yes, I would recommend [InMotion Hosting](https://serp.ly/inmotion-hosting) if you and your audience are from the United States; if not, opt for web hosts that have data center locations near you and your target audience.

If you run a large company with a lot of web traffic, InMotion Hosting might work for you; however, if you run a small business or a personal website, then there are better offers in the market.

I'm not saying that InMotion Hosting is terrible, but other web hosts offer better hosting plans for way cheaper and offer services that are a bang for your buck. InMotion Hosting is also not ideal for beginners or those looking for a low-priced web host provider.

I hope this [InMotion Hosting](https://serp.ly/inmotion-hosting) review has helped you in your journey of finding the best web hosting company!
