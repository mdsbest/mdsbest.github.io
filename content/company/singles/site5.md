## Overview

[Site5](https://serp.ly/site5) was established in 1999 by Matt Lightner & Rod Armstrong, two successful businessmen. Bluehost and HostGator's parent firm, Endurance International Group or EIG, purchased the company in 2015 and renamed it Endurance.

EIG, which owns several of the most renowned web hosting firms, has a bad image in the market. It is well-known that EIG buys small hosting firms and runs them using their original identity while shifting their IT and service infrastructure to low-cost locations like India. Customer of Site5 throughout the duration of and following the EIG transfer.

There was a noticeable decrease in the quality of service over that time period. For the sake of objectivity, let me set my own feelings towards EIG aside for the time being and look at what Site5 has to offer without bias.

## Why Use Site5?

Developing a website requires careful consideration of the hosting options available. In order for it to work properly, it must meet this requirement. A bad hosting company may cause you trouble in the near future if you don't pick wisely. This is a decision that will take some thought and research on your part.

Thus, you must pay close attention to the specifications your project needs in order to function successfully. This will guarantee that you can conduct the complete technical procedure without any difficulties. It is essential to remember if your project requires cPanel for installing WordPress or the other content management system (CMS). In this example, it's included in all of them, but it won't always be. 

It's critical to locate a vendor that is a good fit for your project. If you don't get this right, you'll have no way of knowing if your project will succeed or fail. If you're looking to build and manage a project, Site5 provides everything you need in one place. They provide outstanding stability as a result of their presence. In addition, cPanel is included, allowing you to set up WordPress on your server.

## cPanel and the Management of Accounts

Using the Site5 client area is a breeze. It comes with the well-known cPanel control interface for server administration:

## Site5 Website Builder

It's easy to acquire Site5; everything went just as we anticipated it to. We selected a plan, entered our contact information, and paid using PayPal (there is also card support). Our account was available to use immediately after receiving an email with our login information and some helpful guidance on how to get started.

Almost immediately, I would say. In Site5's account information email, they said we needed to utilize the domain name servers 'Nameserver 1: ()' and 'Nameserver 2: ()' in order to redirect our current domain to their webspace, but that wasn't really helpful. Site5's support knowledgebase, however, guided us to two articles on 'nameservers': dns.site5.com and dns2.site5.com.

We'll get into that later. WHMCS, a robust platform utilized by many web hosts, powers Site5's web account administration system. As long as your prior host utilized the same system as this one, it will be easy for you to use the interface. Upon closer inspection, we found that Site5's dashboards are devoid of the obnoxious advertising and other upselling tactics that may be seen on other hosting provider dashboards. We prefer this strategy, even if it isn't the largest deal.

While hosts have the option to promote their own items on the main site, paying consumers should receive an interface that is useful to customers, not a virtual marketplace. In a complete cPanel setup, Site5's primary site development and management features are just a few clicks away from the website interface. Site5's website states that Softaculous is included with all shared Webhosting plans, yet our HostPro account did not include this feature.

A huge blemish on the company's record must be advertising such an important feature and failing to deliver on it. You can still use the QuickInstall function of the Mojo Marketplace to install WordPress, which is a good thing. Joomla, PrestaShop, Magento, Drupal, ZenCart, and a slew of other applications may be installed using QuickInstall. Maybe it's not essential to offer a website builder with Site5, as this is a hosting service geared for "serious developers."

Domains, databases, personal emails, FTP and SSH, archives, and extensive visitor statistics are all included in CPanel's other modules. When your website is up-and-running, you can see where your visitors are coming from and what they're looking at in real-time. However, Site5's assertion that this is "hosting for serious developers" is not upheld by this collection of tools.

If anything, it's a lot less powerful than some of the consumer hosting services. Despite the fact that we've already mentioned it, Site5's shared hosting does not contain the amazing Softaculous auto-installer, but Namecheap's ultra-budget beginning package does.

## How to Setup a Site5 Hosting Account

The process of installing a hosting service, whether it's Site5 or the other one, can be a time-consuming one. Experts in the subject should be able to follow the instructions without difficulty. Purchasing a Site5 Hosting provider is as simple as going to your website and filling out a form in your browser.

In order to create an account, pick items, and pay for them, there is no need for a download. In order to make use of a hosting service or a specific product, such as WordPress, downloads and installs are required. In this situation, Site5 Hosting, you must always download from their site all the tools they propose for managing each product.

The process of downloading and installation of the Site5 Host cPanel and then using it to administer your server is quite straightforward. The rest of the necessary setups and installs must be done via the service, regardless of whether it is managed or not. Choosing an option to add the website to be exported in cPanel is the only way to submit your WordPress or any other CMS-based website.

However, Site5 provides installation and configuration assistance to all of its clients who do not have prior knowledge of how to set up a hosting account. Using cPanel, you may install and customize popular content management systems (CMS) like WordPress and Joomla.

## Site5 Customer Support

When it comes to web hosting, customer service is essential. You may never need it, but things often go wrong from time to time.

When that happens, you'll be glad to have a safety net around. When it comes to assistance, Site5 has a ticketing system and live chat. When I initially started using Site5, I was blown away by the quality of the customer service and how much importance they focused on making their customers happy.

When I needed help, I felt as If I had a team of professionals on my side. Following EIG's takeover, the enchantment seems to have faded. Time to respond is longer than before, and my impressions of a customer-focused culture are skewed because of this.

## Ability to Choose Server Location

Local SEO rankings may benefit from the ability to select the location server. Search engine optimization experts at Site5 say that having an additional ranking factor for a certain city or area may be marginally advantageous. If you live in one of the 21 different locations available, it's up to you to choose which one you want to visit.

## Site5 Hosting Plans and Pricing

Site5 offers three types of hosting: shared, reseller, and VPS, all of which are already familiar to us. With shared hosting, you may select from one of three levels to find the greatest fit for your needs. Each of the three levels has a different name: Basic, Pro, and Turbo. Free transfer from your present website to Site5 is included with each of these plans, as well as unlimited disk space and bandwidth. The number of websites included in each of these plans varies greatly. If you're just getting started, hosting one website on hostBasic can be a good solution for you.

The other two options, on the other side, provide limitless web hosting. To top it all off, a dedicated IP address is included with the hostPro+Turbo. For the whole two years, you'll pay $9.17 every month, with no upfront fees.

There are three plans in total, although only the hostBasic requires a one-time purchase rather than a recurring monthly fee.  Upgrade to a Fully Managed VPS if your site requires more power than can be provided by shared hosting. In order to keep you focused on your business, it'll take care of server optimization, security management, and upgrades for you. 

There is a Reseller Hosting provider that offers three plans: Starter, Standard, & Premier for those who want to distribute hosting to their clients. All of them have domain reseller accounts, cPanel and WHM, and unmetered resale accounts, and custom DNS nameservers, however they differ in bandwidth and space capacity.  

## Site5 Service Speed

Page Loading Speed: 1.4s Selecting a web host based on their page load time is an important decision to make. SEO, exchange rate, and income are all directly impacted by how well your website performs for its visitors and search engines alike.

Using GTmetrix, we created a simple WordPress testing site on Site5 & measured its speed: 1.4 seconds for an empty WordPress site isn't horrible, but it's a little higher than I'd want. 590 milliseconds for the server to respond (TTFB) Your web host's server refresh rate, also known as Time To First Byte or TTFB, is a significant determinant in how quickly your site responds to visitors (TTFB).

Google's PageSpeed Insights assessed our test site at 590ms: Site5 nearly passed the audit, yet Google deems it a failure because it is so close to 600ms. SiteGround, which is famed for its speed technologies, nailed this test at 50 milliseconds, 540 milliseconds quicker than Site5. Inadequate Speedy Technology Access Site5's page load time & server response time fall short of expectations.

The company's performance isn't particularly awful, but it's evident that it isn't investing in a few critical areas. For instance:

- When it comes to dynamic programs like WordPress, there is no built-in caching option from Site5.

- There are no contemporary SSDs in Site5's servers, instead of relying on old-school spinning hard drives. 

- In addition, Site5 does not support the most recent version of PHP. 

- There is no support for NGINX in Site5, despite the fact that it delivers better performance than Apache servers

## Site5 Uptime

With regards to uptime, Site5 performs well. In reality, it offers a 99.99% guaranteed uptime, with account rewards available if your server experiences downtime throughout the course of a particular month:

## Site5 Security and Backups

Backups of your website's files should be kept up to date at all times. When it comes to maintaining your website's data and files, Site5 may be of use by assisting you with a backup solution. Our servers are also backed up every night, so you don't have to worry about your data.

At the end of each night, we take a full backup of each server's material and store it securely. Every hosting account comes with built-in backup capabilities, so you can effortlessly back up your personal website data. To retrieve your archived files immediately, all you need is a few easy actions.

Backups of your website files, emails, and other data are available at all times through Site5. We make it easy for you to keep track of and retrieve the data on your website by providing you with the tools and services you need.

## Migrations

Account migrations are one place where [Site5](https://serp.ly/site5) goes over and beyond. A single website transfer for new clients may be offered by some web servers for a fee. No matter what type of account you have, Site5 will migrate up to 25 accounts of cPanel or 10 non-cPanel accounts for free.

According to the provider, they can "definitely transfer additional accounts within reason" to their "fully managed VPS hosting."

## Unique Features of Site5 Hosting

Site5's multisite accounts are a perk I enjoy. It's essentially a domain-specific control panel. There are no subdomains or domain pointers in a multisite account like there are in other shared website hosting businesses that employ them.

Once you have a handful of domains, this really helps you keep track of everything. Your web hosting account's main pool of disk space and bandwidth may be adjusted to meet your needs. You may also undo any modifications to your site with a function called a flashback. It's a lifesaver when a website goes down and you don't know what's wrong with it.

## The Pros & Cons of Site5 Hosting

### Pros

- Numerous locations.

- Guaranteed money-back within 45-day

### Cons

## Conclusion

As a whole, Site5 isn't a horrible web host, but its price for features is just too high. In terms of pricing, product selection, features, speed, or service, Site5 falls short of the competitors. 

[Site5](https://serp.ly/site5) is a terrific alternative for those with specific needs because of its wide range of possibilities. However, if you're seeking a low-cost web host, you don't need to pay so much for so little. In the end, we hope that our Site5 review has assisted you in making an informed choice about whether or not this web hosting service is perfect for you.
