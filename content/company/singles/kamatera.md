A validation email will be sent to you. Once you have confirmed this, the account will now be created.

Now on your dashboard, you will be prompted to enter a credit card and provide personal information such as your name, address, and so forth. After that, you're ready to go!

## Using and Managing Your Website on Kamatera

Once you've successfully logged in, you will be greeted with your account dashboard. Here's a brief glimpse at how the dashboard appears:

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/6D8iakkEAXCn-ibVmEAl_xvEiuIJQmHkNscEu6rGB37xrnopDRz4EE9FXRm7UEU_LbCSxivzocprMy4i4YxlgH8XAiSzuUJmYX0159zFK25HG4_UFgpPaCSoq5VMilR_hfSJnelB1kFDJLnkuKR5Y_g)

The account's control panel layout or dashboard is clean. The dashboard's navigation is simple because of a menu on the left panel.

Kamatera's user interface is refreshingly basic and straightforward to use. No one, however, is going to be guiding you while you try to figure out how to install all of the apps. Get your hands on a preferred control panel - these cost extra money but they make it easier to get your moved domain to work.

Nothing would appear on the dashboard if you have not yet set up a server.

After you've finished configuring a server, you can begin using its capabilities. You can manage everything on your server using this dashboard. You can manage almost anything on the dashboard, including reboots, backups, configuration, passwords, and activity.

## Kamatera Control Panel

If you're like us and prefer to use cPanel, you can install your favorite program or control panel without dealing with SSH commands.

When you deploy cPanel with a Kamatera Server, you will incur no additional costs.

To do so, open your Kamatera Console and go to "My Cloud >> Create New App" from the left side menu bar, then select the Zone and finally, the datacenter.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rRLtrRBQN4YFHio3SZwlfbHImKibuuNE5A_zaQ0dcmqoTqXBWG04qfkxS2-HW7wWWxjnfsFjzwH1-iVwNmTiyQJhpZM6zxKgjaJq7qpknfpdwa1mSe5tt31WrSlLp4R2U7TuT65OBwHJm0aZmEiHve0)

Select cPanel and then the version of cPanel from the list on the right. Then select the Server type, CPU size, system memory, and Disk, and make sure that the Detailed view is enabled so that you can get a detailed pricing estimate.

When you're satisfied with the pricing and application settings, click the "Create Server" button.

The action has now been added to the queue. When the deployment is finished, it will appear in your dashboard.

cPanel

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/F1O6Tr4n136gyAFtSeuWchgTlBO8Wf7np_mS445bMZfJJyPx0lM6_gZD2GXUtz7mQkRQFpU8jhiVbAQ2X0ak7srZ-k0fSRpCkrRb-eQ0OZlNeyNLQOE0kxGNON6PIrabX7044TrXJ6ECXVnclRJiOXM)

cPanel is the most widely used panel in the hosting industry since it is easy to use. The control panel is where you can manage your files, databases, email accounts, and other web hosting-related operations.

### Email

One advantage of hosting your website with a cPanel-enabled web host is the possibility to create custom email accounts for your domain.

There are several tools available, such as creating new emails, configuring forwarders and autoresponders, managing spam emails, and so much more.

### Domains

Under the Domains area of cPanel, you can add new domains to your account, set up parked domains, establish subdomains, set up redirects, and even more.

You should have a domain registered and linked to your server before you can set up cPanel. As an outcome, uploading it directly to cPanel will have no influence.

Setting up an extra domain in cPanel is simple, but the first approach can be frightening. In essence, you should register the new domain, connect it to the necessary nameservers, and then add the domain to cPanel so that it can be recognized.

### File Management

Through the files area of cPanel, you may backup your cPanel account, view and modify files stored in your account, monitor your disk usage, and perhaps even create and manage FTP accounts.

#### File Manager

The File Manager, as the name implies, is where you may manage your files. This area allows you to move, edit, upload, update, delete, and restore documents. Instead of utilizing an FTP application, the cPanel File Manager lets you operate your website via HTTP, similar to how a web browser does.

#### Backup

You may store and save your files, databases, forwarders, and filters to a backup file using the Backup feature. If you're not comfortable with cPanel or file backups, the Backup Wizard interface is another option.

#### Disk Usage

Once you sign onto cPanel, you'll find an overview of your disk space consumption on the right side. The overall disk space used by your account includes all data, including website files, MySQL databases, and email messages.

#### FTP

FTP can be used to grant or prohibit accessibility to your hosting account. FTP can be used to upload files to your website. You can define which directories the new user will be able to access and how much space they will take up.

### Databases

The database contains your website's data, including all pages, posts, and personal details. All current websites could not function without a database, which works quietly behind the scenes to manage the website's content.

#### MySQL

MySQL Databases is an application that manages your MySQL databases and users. You have the authority to modify, edit, and remove databases and users. Users' database rights can also be regulated.

##### phpMyAdmin

Before you can use phpMyAdmin to handle databases, you must first create a database in a suitable format. You have absolute control over the content and structure of your database when you use phpMyAdmin. You may import and export data, conduct SQL queries, modify tables and do a variety of other functions in addition to developing and removing columns.

### Metrics

Keeping track of various website metrics is critical to your overall performance in company sales. You may review various statistics, track errors, and monitor your bandwidth usage in the Metrics section.

You could determine where your website's visitors are coming from, how many people are accessing your site, and which portions of your website are being visited the most frequently by using this feature.

### Security

One of the most crucial things you can do is keep your website secure. Using the tools in this category, you may restrict SSH access, ban IP addresses, and restrict your images from being hot-linked. And this is where you can manage your website's security certifications.

### Software

Exploring the software area can help you improve the functionality of your website. Important tools are provided here to assist you with the setting of software on your website. Feel free to take advantage of them.

### Advanced

Actions in this section are ones that are not commonly practiced but are nevertheless suitable for advancement.

### Preferences

Numerous significant components of the cPanel interface can be customized using the Preferences area. Change the display language, for example, by selecting Change Language from the drop-down menu; update your Contact Information and, if needed, reset your cPanel password from this section.

## Kamatera Express

It's simple to get started with Kamatera Express. You can quickly set up your server and adjust CPU, RAM, SSD space, and bandwidth to your preference. Users can practically add an infinite number of resources.

There's no need to be concerned if you're on a tight budget. There is a price calculator to help you stay inside your budget.

The host offers a selection of 9+ operating systems, including CentOS, CloudLinux, Ubuntu, Debian, Windows, and others. If yours is not on the list, you are free to install a new one. 

You may enhance the overall experience by adding premium add-ons such as cPanel/Plesk, daily backups, dedicated IPs, and so on.

Customers can use geolocation to pick servers that are nearest to their users. Even if you choose the default, your audience will have quick access to content regardless of location.

### WordPress on Kamatera

[Kamatera](https://serp.ly/kamatera) offers a variety of WordPress website creation choices, some more sophisticated than others. The simplest method is to use a pre-configured server image that is set up to install WordPress automatically.

With a few clicks, you can install WordPress using Kamatera Express, but you'll need to know how to point your domain name to your new website.

## Kamatera Customer Support

If you're not sure which one to purchase, Kamatera offers sales assistance lines. During business hours, two dedicated lines are available: one for the Middle East and one for the rest of the globe.

The IT team, on the other hand, is available at all times and does an excellent job. Kamatera is at the top of the support game, thanks to quick responses and highly knowledgeable representatives.

Even the most basic free support plan assures you assistance with your operating system and underlying infrastructure within two hours.

However, if you upgrade the service, you can expect considerably faster responses and have the Kamatera web hosting staff handle everything from basic server stack optimization to backup setup, server monitoring, and even app administration for you.

Kamatera provides quick response times to support queries. Not only that, but unlike most cloud computing providers, it also includes complete server management.

If you have a specialized cloud operations staff, support may not be high on your priority list.

However, most consumers can benefit from competent support if their Kamatera VPS is acting up or they need assistance with a complicated setup.

## Buyer’s Guide For Kamatera

[Kamatera](https://serp.ly/kamatera/) is a cloud computing company that operates on a pay-as-you-go basis. You have complete control over your server configuration and can scale up or down at any time.

Because of its adaptability, Kamatera offers over 1500 alternative server configurations. The lowest server costs $4 per month, and you may expand to up to more than $4,000 per month. Keep in mind that this is without considering the option of adding many servers and load balancers, as well as constructing a vast international network.

As you may expect, Kamatera pricing is pretty complex.

Fortunately, Kamatera provides a helpful calculator on their website that will allow you to estimate your final expenditures.

### Kamatera Pricing and Plans

Cloud Hosting plans start at $4/month.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Nt3rAvfMo_0zBrwIJfPzdM8XYuaP6PQkJRHS4wG6NQu04-bH7_WiXe0QXWHeHVpwDoMcF6osfsbYLCVvuWspxK9qWlIAQ7dU-zIr3aHRRXpShYvdFbopH_ByxeMJr-kGonq53q0HfJne0MDOX-xXLBs)

Cloud hosting is a network architecture that is distributed over multiple physical servers. It enables the construction of virtual servers that exploit the infrastructure's pooled resources, delivering several benefits not generally available in shared servers.

Kamatera's servers begin with one CPU core, 256MB of RAM, and 20GB of storage. You may scale up to 104 CPU cores and 512GB RAM per server, as well as virtually any amount of block storage. Even better, Kamatera allows you to select individual resource caps, allowing you to create your own server setup.

If you require more resources than a single virtual machine can provide, you can join additional servers. Kamatera instances have been tuned for load balancing across numerous devices.

In short, no matter how much your app grows, you will always have the perfect amount of server resources.

VPS Hosting plans start at $4/month.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xEPPyWX1uK7KLUjtGPZriUO_G3eZTNHGBL9PvVVuuNMjw-SrZRMCYG6ETic4-KTiQDcmnlawr3vpuJgLZj8Br7wiALUSjlq4wx9OCUOPki7texItuDfke1lIJlxPcbOGAQWHmxG43UKSDiqugmHTz5g)

VPS Hosting is a premium hosting service that combines flexibility with the cost-effectiveness of shared servers. VPS hosting is distributed among several dedicated servers, which collectively comprise a cloud infrastructure. This increases uptime ratings while providing tremendous flexibility to run alternative operating systems and software combinations as needed.

VPS hosting provides unrivaled benefits such as endless scalability, flexibility, unrivaled uptime rates, unrivaled performance, and cost.

The VPS Hosting model is designed primarily for websites that cannot afford downtime but still want to be affordable.

When you choose a Kamatera VPS, you do not have to pay for the entire month. Instead, you are charged hourly and have the option to scale up or down at any time. As a result, if your workload decreases, you can acquire a smaller server and not pay a dollar more than necessary.

In contrast, if you require more power, you are not limited to a small server.

Managed Cloud Services plans priced at $50/month. 

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/z9e2DzlcUpweyhR-YZ6mVYiAb22NAfOIdaTle_JDYNbmw-0Q3dkJjhN6WFsEdIKD-UXWSGiWNG3iRrp8gb1vVLklbM57WfxXAe13AeJUOnfCr7TLeZ9M98mJfNKGM25GuBGsZQd_-xPQxGkQa9-fhCM)

Choosing the level of management was one of the most appealing features while writing this Kamatera review.

The most basic plan is unmanaged, which means Kamatera manages the infrastructure while your developers handle tech stack configuration and app deployment. This is ideal if you want to learn about the cloud or already have someone running the complete setup.

If you require additional assistance, you can pay an additional fee for managed Kamatera cloud hosting.

Managed server hosting is an excellent choice for the non-tech savvy. With this package, Kamatera's technical team handles the difficult task of managing your server.

You can host your site using a Content Management System such as WordPress. It provides a wide array of features to assist you in getting about. Drag-and-drop website builders, productivity and security plugins, and some free templates are among them.

Unfortunately, Kamatera managed cloud is somewhat expensive. It can cost up to $50 per month.

Reseller Hosting

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Mw2rOYrMsFWclPPGEd_57rWAhh7n-_jUN6rXxDuzuOaHZjyBonVezQgYZFExut-aB9KUMqUJj9DkXeuIEvi3XIXM0s5EWwfp90qsW3Q_2E5vU4C8ZNTS381-dgHvKBamySmSkTodn-KiGN639ADm-Fo)

For enterprises and entrepreneurs, the Kamatera reseller package is an excellent choice. There are two options: reselling or white label hosting.

The first offers substantial discounts to clients who resale their products. To take advantage of this, you must make large purchases. You will have access to a billing tool that will allow you to generate individual invoices for your customers.

The other option is white label hosting. It provides users with a plethora of options for customizing services. You may rebrand your website, set your rates, and host services from it. Kamatera's robust API is also offered. It allows you to operate servers via custom applications remotely.

### Server Speed and Uptime

One of the most significant components of a hosting service is website uptime.

The assurance that a Kamatera cloud server will be operational 99.95% of the time is entirely reasonable to hear. This means you don't have to be concerned about your servers decelerating and interfering with your entire business's operations and processes.

Kamatera accomplishes this by deploying numerous data centers that use cutting-edge technology. Your cloud servers remain stable and active at all times, regardless of the circumstances.

According to Website Planet's testing, uptime remained at a steady 100 percent during their admittedly brief testing period.

In terms of server speeds, a quick page speed is crucial for a number of reasons. The average time for the whole website to load was 1.1 seconds. You can improve performance by making a few changes.

### Security and Backups

With Kamatera, it is better not to worry about this subject because, as per user experience, it has all the necessary security measures you require.

Kamatera is well-renowned for its high-security cloud infrastructure. Not only this, but the private cloud network that the company offers is also pretty amazing because it offers added restrictions to data usage.

All this is done to ensure increased safety and security by keeping everything private and under control.

Nonetheless, if any unforeseen thing happens, its constant backup keeping function comes in handy to get every precious thing back in your hands.

Let's dive into details, shall we?

SSL Certificates

All cloud servers include a set of automatic SSL certificates. This can actually cause some confusion because, for some server bundles, the generated SSL certificate is keyed to the server's temporary address.

However, if you choose a server image with a control panel, you can simply generate your own certificates using Let's Encrypt, which isn't a major issue.

Kamatera Firewall

For cloud server protection, Kamatera provides proactive firewall management. It is set up to run on the cloud and successfully protect users from external assaults. It protects against malware, viruses, and DDoS assaults.

Aside from that, the system performs an excellent job of filtering out suspicious traffic. This keeps malicious bots and spams away from your website. It also closes all open ports.

The history of activities is displayed in the protection tab. Advanced users will like it because the details can be used to make further modifications. You can, for example, utilize root access to ban IP addresses and geo-restrict your app/website.

In general, employing WAF accelerates the performance of your projects. It restricts behaviors that would have resulted in excessive latency and slow server output otherwise. According to Kamatera reviews, its excellent accessibility ensures that consumers have a pleasant experience at all times.

Load Balancers

Load balancers are included with the Kamatera cloud servers. The setup works by linking web servers in order to maintain several connections at the same time. It provides several benefits, such as minimal ping time, rapid content delivery, and service availability.

Around peak traffic, the system is set up to disperse load equitably across the network. This is accomplished by efficiently redirecting TCP, UDP, and HTTP requests towards less congested servers. It improves session persistence by decreasing interruption.

This service is charged separately. The advantage is that it is charged on a pay-as-you-go basis. There are no long-term obligations, and you only pay on a per-second basis—a highly cost-effective choice.

Block Storage
