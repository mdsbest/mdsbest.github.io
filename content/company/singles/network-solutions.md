## Getting Started with Network Solutions

Let's check out its page, browse its web hosting offers, and get started with [Network Solutions](https://serp.ly/network-solutions). I like the fact that it has a pretty straightforward homepage with the products listed on tabs so that you can browse them with ease.

For this review, I will look at its cloud web hosting plan, notably the Starter plan. It is ideal for someone like me who is just starting in web hosting and development. 

This plan comes with 15 GB of disk space, one website, five email boxes, and a business tax-saving analysis. It cost $5.69 per month and includes a free domain if you choose the annual terms billing cycle.

![](/images/This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is 0612fe36-6592-4bc9-9444-c7e644cad181.png)

After I clicked the Add to Cart button, I was redirected to a domain registration page where I could choose to register a new domain or use an already existing one.

![](/images/This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is 6d0209ca-ff37-4635-b5db-29a21cad6b85.png)

The domain name I registered was luckily available. I was then confronted with a choice to include domain protection or not. 

When my domain is unprotected, it will be searchable on the WHOIS database, a public database that contains all domain names registered online. This means my personal information like name, address, and contact number will become visible publicly. 

Network Solutions offers one month of free domain protection. It will be renewed for only $1.99 per month.

![](/images/This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is b39613e9-e2a6-4fbb-a309-2b4dca6cbd12.png)

When I clicked continue, I was brought to my shopping cart. I noticed that domain registration was not for free and cost $15 per year. 

After I reviewed everything, I clicked Secure Checkout. Payment methods include credit cards and Paypal.

![](/images/This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is e2b09290-dce0-452f-aeb5-0d314c6edcc5.png)

Next, you can secure your site by adding an SSL certificate for only $1.99 for the first month and renewing at $7.99 per month. 

Getting an SSL certificate can boost your Google SEO ranking, keeps your visitor's browsing details privates, and safeguard your user's information.

After, I was redirected to a page where I had to create an account as a new customer. Included are the following information: name, address, contact number, email add, user id, and password.

![](/images/This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is 74f547d6-ec47-4a98-a96c-1037b6a8e1cc.png)

The next part of the sign-up process is to input my credit card information and billing address.

![](/images/This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is 2533eafb-4b01-4963-bf72-8ea120eca4e0.png)

Once my payment was confirmed, I received a welcome message from Network solutions to verify my account.

In the next section, I will show you how to manage your website using Network solutions.

## Using and Managing your Website with Network Solutions

To manage your website using Network Solutions, you have to log in to its Account Manager using your registered web hosting login details.

![](/images/This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is 945a8cd1-0c3c-49d3-92fb-b2eac1ccac71.png)

You will be greeted by this homepage.

![](/images/This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is 102851ac-19a9-41c0-9aa1-80095b9a0f54.png)

**It has tabs on the following:**

- My Products and Services - containing all purchased products like domain, hosting, site builder, and more

- Account Settings - manage your account preferences and settings

- Special Offers- you can find here the promos and special offer

### Network Solutions Control Panel

![](/images/This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is 326022f7-939b-469d-b17a-42da01001101.png)

A control panel is used to manage your website and your servers. There's a lot of control panels available in the market today. If you have been in web development long enough, perhaps you are familiar with cPanel or Plesk.

Some web hosting providers use a third-party control panel, while others use and create their own. Network Solutions seems to choose the latter. To access your Network Solutions web hosting control panel, you have to log in to your Account Manager and go to the My Hosting Packages section.

From there, you can manage the following:

- Domains - From here, you can secure, renew, set up subdomains, transfer, and check the status of your domain. You can also view and manage your DNS record from here.

- Emails - From here, you can set up your email accounts, troubleshoot email issues, and many more.

- File Manager - From here, you can manage files like uploading a file, creating a new file and folder, and many more. You can also edit, download, copy, delete and move your web hosting files.

- Database Manager- From this, you access your MyPHPAdmin to manage your database and MySQL to create a database.

- Security - This section lets you install, delete, or renew your SSL certificates and other security features, including but not limited to site seal and cybersecurity.

### Network Solutions Website Builder

![](/images/This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is 6ec77b73-20e8-4668-a326-4b4ca8656605.png)

Network Solutions offers a DIY Website Builder for both novice and advanced users. It is an easy way to create your own website without being an expert in web building. It comes with intuitive, user-friendly tools that can be used to customize to fit your website needs.

DIY Website Builder has a template gallery containing more than 150 professional website templates designed for your needs. It was developed to support business growth. If you are unsure what you want and later decide to have e-commerce features later, setting up online shopping and online payment is easy and quick.

You can also add form builders, image galleries, animation, HTML, content blocks, SEO optimization, and many more. Sites are also responsive to all devices, and you can preview them from your dashboard. Changes will automatically be saved if you are connected to the internet.

The Network Solution DIY website building is pretty straightforward. On the left, you can see the following: Build, Pages, Store, Themes, and Settings. On top, you can select a preview style: desktop, tablet, or smartphone. 

Once you are satisfied with the result, you can easily publish your site with a click of a button. 

It is a drag-drop website building, so you can easily add your blocks to your site. 

To start using this site builder, you need to sign up to get a free domain name. I checked my domain's availability, and thankfully it is still available. 

There are three packages to choose from: Website Builder; Website and Online Marketing; Website, Marketing, and Store.

![](/images/This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is fdaa5197-b6be-476b-8104-fde6ce10c071.png)

The cheapest package has an introductory price of $2.95 per month.

![](/images/This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is f9567f6a-c25b-4978-9e8d-9ffa12f59dae.png)

It comes with free custom domain name registration, professional design layouts, the Do-It-Yourself site builder, and many more.

![](/images/This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is e7840b92-7675-476e-9f05-2a7f8cb1b5f2.png)

Upon purchase, an email confirmation and verification will be sent to your account containing login details and including access to Network Solution's library and resource center.

If you are an online business owner, content creator, or blogger who wants to build an online presence, Network Solutions also offers a professional site for you. It is for a fee, of course, but this means you don't have to worry about the building process.

![](/images/This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is c05ed5ad-94de-43ec-b153-62ad35bd4eb2.png)

### Network Solutions App Installer

Most hosting companies include an app installer in their dashboard. While accessing mine, I couldn't find it, so I asked for help from Network Solution customer support. 

I was pointed to the knowledge base to read about the process of installing an application.

From the Site Enhancement section, click Open Source Applications. You will see a list of open source applications that are available for a one-click installation. Click Add New, then Set-Up and Installation.

![](/images/This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is 583906d8-8220-474d-94aa-b2110eb26e28.png)

### Network Solutions Customer Support

Customer and technical support should be one of the factors you need to consider in choosing a web host. There are times what we are really stuck and don't know the answer to our hosting problems. Having experts to rely on is an advantage that any hosting provider should be prioritized.

For this review, I used the live chat feature to asked about Network Solution's control panel. You can also choose the telephone support option. I made a mistake because I did not choose a category of the query first. I went back and chose Domain, Hosting, and Website as a category because that is where my question falls under.

![](/images/This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is f7ae8c77-ca10-4fc3-856a-4cac78229330.png)

I asked about the dashboard or control panel that they used. Ray was accommodating in pointing me in the right direction until I could find what I was looking for. He sent me links and guides I could read. I also asked about free site migration, but unfortunately, they do not have that offer.

![](/images/This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is fd002451-6897-4a3e-ba5f-6af77c2c29bd.png)

Included in their support is a list of knowledgebase. I like that it is categorized according to its services.

## Final Thoughts

Although [Network Solutions](https://serp.ly/network-solutions) was considered the first domain registrar, we couldn't say the same for web hosting. Many companies were offering hosting services before they actually decided to play in that field.

Network Solutions hosting options are limited to cloud web and WordPress hosting only. Many Network Solutions alternatives offer more inclusions in their hosting plans, including VPS(Virtual Private Server) and dedicated server.

Would I recommend Network Solutions?

Yes! If you are looking to spend money in one place from domain to hosting and web building, and other services, then you can go ahead and try Network Solutions. Otherwise, there is so many web hosts company with more features but for a lesser price, like [Namecheap](https://serp.ly/namecheap).

I hope this [Network Solutions](https://serp.ly/network-solutions) review helped you in your web hosting journey!
