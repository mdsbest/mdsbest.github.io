## Highlights

- DigitalOcean Review

[DigitalOcean](https://serp.ly/digitalocean) is an American cloud hosting company based in the United States created with developers at heart.

Alec Hartman, Mitch Wainer, Ben Uretsky, Moisey Uretsky, and Jeff Carr founded the corporation in New York City.

The company has grown at an exponential rate since deploying its first server in 2011. They are among the most reliable and recognized cloud hosting providers in the market, with over 550,000 developers as customers.

DigitalOcean hosting features a large number of data centers located all around the world.

There are currently eight centers throughout the globe, located in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore, and India.

This is beneficial to your company if many of your users are located in a particular region of the world and require high-speed servers near their area. If a client is significantly closer to a server, page loading times should be faster, allowing them to access your site more promptly.

In this review, we'll take an in-depth look at Digital Ocean's performance, reliability, and pricing.

Is it really worth your money hosting your website with this provider? Read on to find out!

## Getting Started With Digital Ocean

To start, head on to the [Digital Ocean](https://serp.ly/digitalocean/) website.

Thoughts on the homepage? I could say that it is the signup page. Literally.

There are no introductory offers and such, although there is a small banner of freebies indicated once you sign up.

As a future customer, I'd say that this is not as effective as putting your lowest prices directly on the homepage.

If you scroll down, you will see a list of platforms that, I assume, are hosted by DigitalOcean, such as Slack, along with the features they offer as you browse.

DigitalOcean, unlike other hosting providers, focuses on cloud computing and does not provide shared or VPS hosting. When you initially visit the website, it can be challenging to determine what it accomplishes. It attempts to attract web developers, and its minimalist homepage is intended to repel non-technical users.

Here's an overview of the plans they offer:

For this review, we'll go for the Droplet - Basic plan. With this, you get 1GB of memory, 1vCPU, 25GB of SSD, and 1000GB of transfers.

Once you have decided which plan you are going for, click Create.

As you can see, this took us to the login page; as someone new, you may click the Sign-Up button on the top right of the page.

Here, you have three options to sign up for an account - via Google, Email, or GitHub.

After verifying your email address, you will be asked to submit and verify a pre-payment to prevent spam.

Note: For increased security, it is strongly advised that you use two-factor authentication.

You'll need a smartphone with the Google Authenticator app; otherwise, you'll be able to get SMS messages.

After your payment has been verified, our account has now been established. On the Welcome Screen, we were asked to create a project and get started.

Because DigitalOcean isn't a domain registrar, you can't buy or obtain a free domain, and there aren't many extra add-ons like a CDN. If you want any extras, you'll have to buy them from a third-party source.

Let's proceed to the actual account management, shall we?

## Using and Managing Your Account on Digital Ocean

To gain access to your DigitalOcean account, simply click the login button on the homepage.

When you create on DigitalOcean, you can have complete control over your infrastructure with solutions like Droplets and floating IPs, or you can let them handle it for you with App Platform, DigitalOcean Load Balancers, and Managed databases.

You may add more storage to your project as needed, scale up or down as your workload changes, and interact with others in an orderly manner from within their platform.

## Digital Ocean Control Panel

DigitalOcean has a custom control panel with an option for cPanel.

### Profile

You may update your name and address, change your login method, change your email settings, and deactivate your account on your profile page. There is also a shortcut to enable two-factor authentication.

#### Edit Profile

The Edit Profile section lets you modify any of the fields below:

This part also shows your account's present Droplet limit as well as a hyperlink to request an upgrade.

#### Sign-In Method

The Sign-in method area allows you to select how you want to log in to your DigitalOcean accounts, such as email and password, Google OAuth, or GitHub OAuth.

You may switch between sign-in methods by opening the Change pull-down menu and selecting the one you would like to use. However, suppose you are currently using OAuth and switch to another account with the same provider. In that case, you must first select a different login option and then return to select a different account.

#### Email Preferences

The Email Preferences section contains a link to the Subscriptions Preference Center, where you can choose in or out of receiving emails from DigitalOcean.

#### Deactivate Account

By visiting the Deactivate Account area, you can deactivate your account and delete all of your account data, including email addresses and payment information.

To deactivate your account, you must erase all of its resources and pay any outstanding invoices.

### Security

Your account's Security section allows the user to set two-factor authentication and check your account's SSH keys, SSL certificates, and security history.

#### Two-factor Authentication

Using two-factor authentication with a username and password-based login adds an extra degree of security to your account against illegal access. 

Even if a malicious user obtains your password, they will be unable to access anything unless they have access to your phone.

You can do the following actions using Two-factor authentication:

- Turn on two-factor authentication.

- As an authentication method, you can select SMS or an Authenticator App.

- Enable a backup plan if in case you lose access to your phone.

- As a backup option, you can use SMS to another phone number or backup codes.

- Turn off two-factor authentication.

#### SSH Keys

SSH keys make logging onto your Droplet more secure. Therefore, they are recommended for all users.

In this part, you can upload and name an SSH public key for your account. After you've provided a key, you can pick it during Droplet creation to have it added to new Droplets automatically. SSH keys can also be added directly to preexisting Droplets.

#### Certificates

SSL certificates are required for some product features, such as load balancer SSL termination and custom Spaces CDN destinations. The SSL certificates supplied to your account can be managed under the Certificates section of your account security tab.

To generate fully managed SSL certificates, use the Let's Encrypt integration. Manually uploading custom certificates or certificates from a commercial certificate authority is also an option.

#### Security History

The security history displays a timeline of actions performed in your accounts, such as user logins, resource creation, deletion, and password changes. It also provides the device's IP address from which the activity was initiated, and the time the action occurred.

The security history shows account occurrences over the past 12 months. You may open a support ticket if you need access to older data.

### Teams

Teams are beneficial for project managers and business owners who want to delegate server infrastructure authority to developers, finance administrators, and other contributors.

You can form several teams, and the number of participants on each team is unlimited. Each team is separately billed and has its payment details.

### Referrals

#### Referral Program

You can earn account credit by recommending others to DigitalOcean if you appreciate the services and want to share them with your friends and coworkers.

When someone uses your referral link to sign up for DigitalOcean and adds a valid payment method, they will earn a $100, 60-day account credit. In exchange, we will credit you $25 after the person you referred spends $25 as a DigitalOcean customer. The amount of referral credit you can earn is unlimited.

#### Referral Link

Referral links are distinct to each user and team, so make sure to use the referral link from the relevant accounts. Unfortunately, you cannot cash out referral credit or move it to other accounts or teams.

In the Share your link area, you'll see your unique referral link as well as the opportunity to share it straight on Twitter.

You can invite up to 30 individuals every day, and the total amount of invitations you can send is unlimited.

#### Referral Badge

You can also include a graphic emblem on your website or in your content to drive users to your referral URL.

There are three badge styles to choose from in the Add a referral badge section.

They automatically provide an Embed Code in HTML or Markdown with the badge design you choose and your referral link already included for your benefit.

#### Referral Statistics

The referral section also includes data about your link, such as how many times it was viewed and how many referrals you've produced. 

You may also check how much credit has been added to your account and how much credit is awaiting from referrals who have not yet satisfied the spending requirement.

### Droplets

DigitalOcean refers to their virtual server machines as "Droplets."

They are technically virtual machines based on Linux. These machines run on virtualized hardware, allowing them to be scaled as necessary. So, when you create a droplet, you are effectively assigned a VM on top of cloud infrastructure hardware.

There are three dedicated CPU plans and one shared CPU plan to choose from. These droplets attempt to give the end-user additional options by selecting the best one for their needs. The idea is to find the perfect fit so that you don't overpay for something you don't need or use a droplet that doesn't meet your needs and results in poor performance.

### Kubernetes

DOKS (DigitalOcean Kubernetes Service) is a managed Kubernetes service that allows you to establish Kubernetes clusters without dealing with the intricacies of managing the control plane and containerized infrastructure. Clusters are utterly compatible with regular Kubernetes toolchains and automatically connect with DigitalOcean Load Balancers and block storage volumes.

With their technique, you may concentrate on your job while streamlining your automated applications. Instance replication, deployment, cluster scheduling, and proper application releases are all possible with DigitalOcean Kubernetes.

### App Platform

App Platform is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) feature that lets developers publish code straight to DigitalOcean servers without worrying about the underlying hardware.

App Platform could instantly evaluate and generate code from your GitHub, GitLab, or public Git repositories before publishing your application to the cloud, or it may publish a container image that you've already posted to DigitalOcean Container Registry or Docker Hub.

It also includes lifecycle administration tools, vertical and horizontal scaling, push-to-deploy support, introspection, and monitoring tools, and built-in database administration and integration, basically everything a developer needs to get code into production.

### Databases

#### Redis

Redis is an open-source key-value database with an in-memory framework that prioritizes performance. Rich data types, atomic operations, and Lua scripting are all supported.

Droplets are used to host all managed databases. You can install your managed database on a Droplet with a shared CPU with other DigitalOcean customers or on a server with a dedicated CPU.

#### MySQL

MySQL is an open-source, object-relational database designed for speed and dependability. Its vast and active developer community has produced some third-party apps, tools, and frameworks that extend the capability of MySQL.

MySQL database clusters are in General Availability. More information about the data center areas and product availability can be found in the regional availability matrix.

Read-only nodes can be added in geographically dispersed data centers.

Additionally, MySQL-specific performance metrics assist you in assessing the database's integrity, pinpointing performance bottlenecks, and identifying odd usage practices that may suggest an application fault or security attack.

Metrics for the MySQL master server include connectivity, index vs.sequential reads, and operations performance. Throughput and latency for fetches, inserts, deletes and updates are among the MySQL database metrics.

#### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is an open-source, object-relational database designed with extensibility, data integrity, and efficiency in mind. It is entirely ACID-compliant due to its concurrency support. 

It allows dynamic loading and catalog-driven operations to enable users to configure its data types, functions, and much more.

### Volumes

DigitalOcean Block Storage is a flexible and user-friendly approach to manage additional storage - in the form of volumes, for your Droplets.

Volumes are self-contained resources that can be moved across Droplets in the same location. You can raise the size of a volume without turning off the Droplet to which it is attached. They're most beneficial when you need more storage but don't require the extra processing power or memory that a larger Droplet would provide.

Volumes, similar Droplets, are backed up by SSDs.

Because volumes operate as generic block devices, you can use associated volumes as if they were locally linked storage drives. This allows you to use conventional tools and procedures to partition, format, and manage volumes.

Volumes hold data on hardware distinct from the Droplet and are replicated many times across various racks, lowering the possibility of data loss due to hardware failure.

### Spaces

Spaces is an object storage service that is S3-compatible that allows you to store and serve massive volumes of data. Each Space is a unit in which you can store and distribute files. The free, built-in Spaces CDN speeds up page loads, increases performance, and lowers bandwidth and infrastructure expenses.

Spaces are suitable for storing unstructured static material such as audio, video, and photos, as well as vast quantities of text. Because Spaces is an object storage solution, use cases such as databases, server-side applications, and mission-critical applications will operate best with local storage or block storage.

A Spaces subscription allows you to establish many Spaces to use as logical units for content segmentation. Each Space has a distinct URL.

### Domains/DNS

Once you establish a domain to your [DigitalOcean](https://serp.ly/digitalocean) account, you can manage DNS records using the control panel and API. DigitalOcean domains now interact with DigitalOcean Load Balancers and Spaces to simplify automatic SSL certificate management.

DNS administration is provided for both DigitalOcean and non-DigitalOcean resources across all regions.

The DNS tools provided by DigitalOcean allow you to manage DNS records for both DigitalOcean and non-DigitalOcean resources in the same place where you manage your server.

### Cloud Firewalls

To secure your servers from foreign threats, firewalls create a barrier between them and the network's external machines. Firewalls could be host-based and set per server through services such as IPTables or UFW. Others, such as DigitalOcean Cloud Firewalls, are network-based and halt traffic before it reaches the server.

Every region has access to cloud firewalls. The rules of a cloud firewall can encompass Droplets through any data center.

Cloud Firewalls from DigitalOcean are a free, network-based, stateful firewall solution for your DigitalOcean Droplets. They restrict all traffic that isn't explicitly allowed by a rule. 

Droplets that are secured by a firewall can be defined individually or by employing tags.

You can implement cloud firewall rules to individual Droplets, but using tags is the more powerful way. 

Tags are personalized labels that can be applied to Droplets and other DigitalOcean resources. If you add a tag to a firewall, it immediately includes any Droplets with that tag in its setting.

### Floating IPs

Floating IPs allow you to divert network traffic between Droplets in the same data center. A Droplet's initial public IP address is not replaced or changed when a floating IP address is assigned.

Floating IPs can be used to establish server infrastructures without a single point of malfunction, but they do not necessarily ensure high availability. To make a configuration generally accessible, you must create a failover mechanism that automates the process of identifying active server failures and reassigning the floating IP toward a passive server.

Across all data centers, floating IPs are available. They are datacenter-specific resources that can only be allocated to Droplets within the same data center.

Floating IP addresses on DigitalOcean are publicly available static IP addresses in which you can assign to Droplets and quickly remap across Droplets in the same data center. To develop a high availability architecture, employ a failover method using floating IPs.

### Load Balancers

The performance of a load balancer is determined by its size. Larger load balancers have greater compute resources, which allows them to manage more concurrent users and requests per second (RPS) than smaller ones.

But, performance may differ considerably on the demand of the load balancer. Using various protocols and package management configurations will yield varying results. As a result, they are unable to provide exact performance numbers for each load balancer size. So it is strongly advised that you run your own tests to determine what size works best for your application's particular needs.

Load balancing services, such as DigitalOcean Load Balancers, provide the perks of load balancing without the administrative burden of handling operational difficulties.

Load Balancers from DigitalOcean are a fully-managed, highly available network load balancing solution. Load balancers route traffic to groups of Droplets, separating the overall health of a backend service from the health of a single server and ensuring that your services remain operational.

### Monitoring

DigitalOcean Monitoring is a free, opt-in service that collects metrics on Droplet-level resource usage. It adds new Droplet graphs and offers customizable metrics alert policies with integrated email and Slack alerts to help you monitor the functional health of your server.

Monitoring on DigitalOcean is powered by an open-source agent that collects system-level metrics in one space. Within the control panel, you can easily view graphs, track performance, and set up alarms. Activate monitoring for new and existing Droplets using the control panel or API.

#### Droplet Graphs

Droplet graphs are a graphical depiction of system-level data which provide a high-level perspective of resource consumption. This could allow you to understand how your resource usage evolves and how different resource levels connect to one another.

Droplet graphs, by default, only provide information on public and private bandwidth usage, CPU usage, and disk I/O. Additional data, such as load average, memory consumption, and disk utilization, are available with DigitalOcean Monitoring.

#### Alert Policies

Alert policies are rules defined by the user that specify resource consumption boundaries. Notifications are sent via email or Slack when consumption surpasses the limit.

Metric-based alerts for total CPU usage, incoming bandwidth, outgoing bandwidth, disk read, disk write, memory consumption, and disk usage is available with DigitalOcean Monitoring.

#### Metrics Agent

The DigitalOcean metrics agent is an open-source Go program that sends basic Droplet measurements to the DigitalOcean metrics backend. It presently supports the following operating system: Ubuntu 14.04 and later, CentOS 6 and later, Debian 8 and later, and 

Fedora 27 and later.

It is also possible to run the agent as a Docker container.

For outgoing data, the DigitalOcean metrics agent uses ports 80 and 443. It is not necessary to have inbound access. Because the metrics agent only needs the ports for outward data, you can securely host a web server.

To receive an authentication token, port 80 is needed to communicate with the DigitalOcean metadata service. This token is used by the metrics agent to verify the metrics backend and encrypt its messages.

## Digital Ocean Customer Support

[DigitalOcean](https://serp.ly/digitalocean/) provides customer support via their ticketing system. This can be viewed as a disadvantage because tickets usually take time to respond to. Should you require immediate customer support by phone or chat, DigitalOcean is not really for you.

They do, however, give comprehensive documentation - Docs, where you can find solutions to the majority of your difficulties.

The community is also essential to DigitalOcean's success. This is where you can meet actual individuals who can help you work through your issue. You also have access to technical tutorials that explain how DigitalOcean operates.

## Buyer’s Guide For Digital Ocean

Despite its primary focus on cloud hosting, DigitalOcean has a lot of options to select from.

It provides platforms for various datasets, ranging from scalable droplets for app deployment to its spaces solution for file storage and “worry-free” database hosting.

You can select which goods are of most interest to you and only pay for what you use.

## DigitalOcean Pricing and Plans

Because of the nature of cloud hosting, DigitalOcean has a slightly different [pricing plan](https://serp.ly/digitalocean/) than many other web hosting providers. Instead of charging you a set monthly charge for specific products, you can create your own web hosting service based on how many resources you utilize.

It also employs a capping mechanism, which means that you will be billed hourly up to a monthly ceiling of 672 hours, after which you will be charged the fixed monthly amount.

Basic Droplet Plans start at $5.00/month.

You could commence with their $5 per month cloud hosting plan, which includes 1GB RAM, 1 CPU, 25 GB SSD Disk, and 1000 GB Transfer. The basic plan takes advantage of a shared CPU.

Additionally, Basic Droplets are similar to that of shared hosting.

The pricing for a dedicated CPU is listed below.

General Purpose Droplet Plans start at $60.00/month.

When it comes to dedicated hyper threads and memory, General Purpose Droplets provide a nice balance. The droplet can host general-purpose projects, including e-commerce websites, production workloads, web apps, and even business applications.

General Purpose Droplets start at $60 per month and include 8 GB of RAM, two CPUs, a 25 GB SSD storage, and four TB of transfers.

CPU-Optimized Droplet Plans start at $40.00/month.

The compute-optimized virtual server machines are perfect for applications that require a large amount of processing power. For example, machine learning, batch processing, video converting and encoding, and other projects fall under this category.

CPU-Optimized Droplets cost around $40 per month and include 4 GB of RAM, 2 CPUs, a 25 GB SSD storage, and 4 TB of transfer space.

Memory-Optimized Droplet Plans start at $80.00/month.

The memory-optimized CPU is configured to deliver 8 GB of high-capacity RAM. This CPU droplet is great for real-time extensive data processing, high-performance databases, and other tasks.

Memory-Optimized Droplets are priced at $90 per month, including 16 GB of RAM, two CPUs, a 50 GB SSD disk, and four TB of transfers.

Storage-Optimized Droplet Plans start at $125.00/month.

The base price for Storage-Optimized Droplets is $125 per month, including 16 GB of RAM, two CPUs, a 300 GB SSD disk, and four TB of transfers.

## Server Speed and Uptime

When choosing a web host, the most important statistic to consider is uptime.

And besides, all the bells and whistles in the world won't matter if your website is down for extended periods of time.

Tech Site Reviews' uptime tests revealed that their test site had an average uptime of 99.99 percent. This is a fantastic deal for its customers!

Speed comes in a close second.

For all kinds of reasons, lagging websites may as well be ‘down.' Websites that are too slow to load are nearly impossible to use. Your visitors will not hesitate to bounce. Really. A few seconds gap can lose you practically all of your prospective site traffic.

Fortunately, when you sign up with DigitalOcean, you won't have to worry about poor speeds.

The site of Tech Site Reviews had an average speed of 218ms during its fastest times, compared to the industry average of 890ms. On the other hand, at its slowest speeds, it was 496ms - which is still far faster than the industry average!

## Security and Backups

Your information and traffic are always safe. This is something that other cloud providers either do not highlight or do not give. DigitalOcean ensures that your data is secure from beginning to end. It's a huge benefit to keeping malicious interactions and malware out of your site's system.

DigitalOcean has encrypted all of its volumes by default. To add an extra layer of protection, like with most of their features, you'll need to go through a tutorial, follow the instructions, and be familiar with basic coding.

In addition, despite DigitalOcean's excellent uptime, it's always best to be safe than sorry. DigitalOcean provides daily backups, and you can always restore any data from up to 7 days prior.

## Final Thoughts

[DigitalOcean](https://serp.ly/digitalocean) is a cloud computing provider that gives software developers an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform. DigitalOcean is a popular open-source web hosting provider that competes with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Compute Engine.

Now the question is, do we recommend DigitalOcean?

Yes and no. For beginners, this would be difficult to navigate, especially if you're only looking for hosting services for a small business or personal website.
