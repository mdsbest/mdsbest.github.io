Sage Weil, Michael Rodriguez, Josh Jones, and Dallas Bethune, four friends from Harvey Mudd College in California, founded Dreamhost web hosting in 1997. The company name, New Dream Network, LLC, was legally registered in 1997, and they started hosting websites at that time. 

Michael Rodriguez is the current CEO of Dreamhost. The web hosting company hosts over 1.5 million websites and has over 400,000 users in over 100 countries worldwide. [Dreamhost](https://serp.ly/dreamhost) takes pride in being a multi-award-winning WordPress host. 

Dreamhost has the right to be proud, given that they host over 1.5 million sites for 400,000+ customers and are one of just four web providers that WordPress itself endorses. 

## Getting Started With DreamHost

To start, head to the [DreamHost](https://serp.ly/dreamhost) website. 

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pe04Zw653bPx32E7lt_JO-H04DyK7gM3Rriw1odYz1Nr2uWAuy8NZPGErfuwgRWGg3efIUNPEH7W75Wv3hyrBQe0ImDVqkbAVxeHHhgzXSoAYLCCXSaDXR6a1Vf7TWnvtne5q9Y6U8Y5y-Ah5NN0mG8)

You will be greeted with a blue-toned page with their offers on the lower part of the homepage. DreamHost's logo, though - reminds me of DreamWorks because of the moon! The Main Menu tab on the upper part would be your way of navigating the DreamHost Homepage. 

Here you have WordPress, Hosting, Websites, Domains, Email, Pro Services, and Academy. You will be redirected to a page where you sign up for Shared Hosting, specifically by clicking Get Started. If you wanted to explore their offers first, then you could always click the Hosting tab and browse from there. Shared Web Hosting - a shared web hosting plan with a custom-built control panel

For this DreamHost review, we went for the cheapest Shared Web Hosting plan - Shared Starter. This subscription costs $2.59/month for a 3-year subscription. With Shared Starter, you get one website, a free domain name, pre-installed WordPress, Free automated WordPress migrations, WP website builder, Fast SSD storage, and a free SSL certificate. 

To start, click 'Sign Up Now.' Here, you will have three steps to complete the sign-up process with picking your plan as the first step. Step 2: Choose a Domain

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Y-Szp2Z7wqVLNznoMemcuh5RdvClT8sScljTSJ6bOCWx9nBqLcWvjPGC6LEfMZWEl93zD6g4abGb_MrpcjCtlqxZRDs5GyFpcm3D7Q8hp8EwJ3aciy9nsIioXzwzLOiGwnPCOQqfu2_WGRD8b39YqHE)

Here, you can set up your domain, or if you already have an existing domain, you can transfer it here as well. In addition, DreamHost offers a free domain with the Shared Starter plan for annual terms. Step 3: Secure Checkout 

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/44aGyHePjTdhwMRx5L0hiZfqU1T9ZKBruefagJMA0pXGIglXyYG-aIJco2oCsIBhHCCuCdRTYnzUDWcmaTulGkIn5lNkBvUUspYGueR4vXnX9QkJ2FGL5yPtjYrhwYs7iAdqM7AMoTRu7WaKB9NjJ90)

You have two payment options - you can pay via Credit Card or using PayPal. On this page, you need to type in your card details and billing information. 

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/D-sjxRDOwVZJTtp65JWKaRnkf85MrEDKLwBCHYPfIXOR75ohZvWUXCE0-IM-v9GRgDLzgRzz2QLvendFLBjl4w-9OwMybvfwAXdYQsEHdZgJCfJQ4LFaX4Sn0HWHgnAy-auombcw9kqDFblXWrdXkCU)

You will also need to key in your email address, name, and phone number as you scroll down. An alternative to that would be signing up using Google to speed up the process. 

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tFM2donb7P6ahpRSQymAQz_cbFzH2JGLh3S5few6RhZ7xD1_zd4QrRbW1NOX5ojHPAgoeR3xkjo3UX0cxjGpm0D2p2VNH0-vhBA5E3fFXpDzzCKWnMPMJjVoGibgCQ8lcmoMGAdaaySOdCdadbrhLX4)

You can purchase additional software and plugins to boost your site's performance and security on this tab. Once you're done filling out all the forms, click Submit Order. 

Note: The account verification might take about 24 hours. After completing the signup process, you will receive an email informing you that your account has been created. You can then log in to the panel. Then you're all set!

## Using and Managing Your Website on DreamHost

To log in, enter the credentials provided in the email you received [here](https://serp.ly/dreamhost/). 

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/eMODvjHwj-j0AG-39zAqAMzHrw_e2uAY-ymWNuLnck56uh2z1jS6WIl2f1Lkzsfs-RFwfkhQO1R_zzeScAn5VWZcKIyCjMEy955F6AKq8kPmV1FIQ-FLzkWpL03XLBFRCOTSQbfv35Y8j7ObhpO0GgA)

After logging in, you will now have access to your account's dashboard.

Here, you have the navigation menu on the left side of your page. This is the master list for all of the pages in your panel. Each part comprises information about the various activities you can take once they are selected.

## DreamHost Panel

DreamHost somehow doesn't make use of cPanel. Instead, they created their own custom control panel with all of the management tools found in cPanel. You can simply manage MySQL databases, change PHP versions, get 1-click WordPress installs, control SSH and FTP access, and far more.

### Home

The only button is 'Get Started,' which takes you to the main dashboard page of the panel, where you can read about DreamHost offerings.

### Websites

Domain services such as hosting, DNS, MySQL databases, and SSL/TLS certificates are managed here. To log onto your server, you can alternatively use a file manager. 

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/U6PzkrNG0pojuWb3HwQPux8Mtbp0GDphiI2vNCmSNj1G2liHTOb81JnN6prdd9YKdt1bpa32_UqmotM-IrqRiCWXIue5h_rX4G3n7t_W9-qO8xOErJ-Cnz1QaKnxR77KiHgGnWiH0idzvYtTncpzwk4)

The Manage Websites page gives an updated and graphical display of each of your domains, providing you with a consolidated perspective from which you can quickly make features and setting updates to any of your DreamHost domains. 

You can access your domain files and add new FTP/SFTP/Shell users to your server via the Files page. The MySQL Databases page allows you to add/manage databases that your website will use. 

You can add an SSL certificate to your domain on the Secure Certificates page, allowing it to be accessible via the HTTPS protocol.

### File Manager

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8MTdhc3lSFF42UibeaELnAuTvzY0oWpfMS562HOi4TronMPqs4vV5Q2LZqMD7mYuMuDGq4DN5PK0FyEBkVeHTyY_rLMs3210wQYeqk3u0R6BJZK2QyjM0CTXaTxPtc5cNiowuoUpLs9FpnvvvV15Tuo)

DreamHost's control panel includes a file manager that you can use to upload and administer your website's files. The file manager in the panel is a faster and easier solution than a fully-functional FTP client like Filezilla, and it can handle most of your site's demands.

### Domains

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/1YTWbgf-x28veIry-DFTnKLt-r4LOiW-XxWRAWnAyvO1XvmNx97tYV4giC2KKH7e1vbqj_YFT49yWYPSdlJQP529c0YBIO_3wxbjCGXVL2PLEEaKrwO9Huyi6vC4rgL2-Of2P6vXLWAitRUD8sTErtM)

In this section, you may handle domain registrations and transfers. You can manage multiple aspects of your domain's hosting from the Manage Domains page. You can add hosting here, change the domain's configurations, and recover previously backed up site files. 

The Registrations tab allows you to establish a new domain and manage existing domain registrations with DreamHost. Domain WHOIS changes, including nameservers and registration renewal settings, and domain locking, can be made from this page. You can transfer the domain registration to or from DreamHost on the Reg. 

Transfer page, as well as acquire the domain's authorization code. You can install and manage WordPress on the One-Click Installs page.

### WordPress

This part includes links to see your DreamPress site's information and add more resources to improve your WordPress sites.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/AygM07NxZGdKDwYRLCdsIk0f8ISrUbINj6Zr9RzfELhYqdkUgBqyE5s1FwXIoLZaI7Rzhx-zjECVzrRwPCDv9SEs0BW6U-rXwNSJpMlAvC9s4xNT4zqszKJCnMzCHJT_GweOMLj1wi8J0U8DLGSeuhA)

- Managed WordPress — Access signup details as well as general information about your DreamPress site.

- DreamPress Resources — Browse additional resource solutions to help you improve your DreamPress website.

### Mail

In this section, you may manage email accounts and services such as filters, Discussion/Announcement Lists, MX records, and more. 

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/M2jK5fEn6fejmfbZhwfNOwef09C3HBatitOWTrELwvAG7n7oKJ4EkIRQ_ROUBqYmonZ-zjD7mvV6In71sL4ff27G5E3zqAzYkhGn1gfaA7SvTqv5l52ESYBXeNypDs_ylVwsL1v6PfZaX8jb1VT7GnY)

You can add, change, and remove email addresses on the Manage Email page. You can alter passwords, disk limit quotas, and configure the email as fully hosted or as a forward-only address by selecting the Edit button to the right of any address. 

On the Webmail page, you can find the current URL for Webmail and if DreamHost hosts it. You can edit your domain's MX records on the Custom MX page. You can input custom MX records, use Google Workspace to set up your email, or simply retain your mail services with DreamHost. 

The Announcement Lists page allows you to create an Announcement List. This list enables you to transmit to hundreds or even thousands of subscribers without exceeding your SMTP quota for ordinary email. You can construct filters to stop incoming spam on the Anti Spam page. 

Unfortunately, this feature is not available with non-DreamHost mail services. You can create a Discussion List on the Discussion Lists page so that subscribers can contact each other via a single email. 

This is a great function that does not affect the standard SMTP quota. On the Message Filters page, you may add custom filters. This feature enables you to set particular filters to manage incoming emails in any way you see fit. 

You can create a custom autoresponder on the Autoresponders page. Anyone who sends you an email will receive a response from this autoresponder. This tool is useful when you are unavailable for an extended time, such as during a trip.

### Billing and Account

Your panel's Billing & Account area allows you to manage and track practically all aspects of your account. You may make payments, check invoices, set up security measures, backup your account, create incentives, and view use in this section. 

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/PdPPhCW40fOsxyvO-8f2AwMtwuWSY6c-J4xf9pA3WAxYEmYAkRh9epBK_3xdFgacT1hf9bpXZc9HAQx3dqAiJ_MqQh8961qVuJZL0xkR4_jLIa-gxcNhG-X1AJgsOMX10Jbck13-lU4JYJ8LAgxxilk)

The Manage Account page gives you a comprehensive overview of your panel. You may add certain email addresses and control what they can access in your panel on the Account Privileges page.

You can make a payment on the Manage Payments page. You may also add or edit your payment method information here. You may print or view invoices on the View Invoices page. 

You can also see a detailed record of all charges and credits applied to your account. You may update passwords, multifactor authentications, secret question and answer, IP locking, and check active sessions on the Security page. 

The Backup Your Account page makes it simple to create a full account backup. The Bandwidth Usage page displays bandwidth usage statistics by domain. Disk usage is listed per user, fully hosted domain, email address, database, and Discussion List on the Disk Usage page.

### Support

This section contains resources to the Knowledge Base, panel help, data centers, and the Contact Support page.

For most small businesses that do not receive a lot of traffic, shared web hosting is the most cost-effective alternative. Shared hosting implies that your website is stored on the same server as other websites. 

DreamHost Shared hosting Starter option is ideal for novices who only have one new website and don't know where to begin. It provides the fundamental hosting tools your website will require, such as one WordPress website, a free domain, and unlimited bandwidth. 

For $9.95 per month paid annually, DreamHost also offers the Shared Unlimited plan, which includes everything in the Shared Starter plan as well as unlimited emails and websites. This is a wonderful solution for individuals who have various websites and require different email accounts. VPS Hosting plans start at $10.00/month.

If you have a larger company, use e-commerce, or are a designer or developer, a VPS hosting package may be suitable for you. Virtual Private Servers provide the benefits of a dedicated server without the greater cost. 

Individual resources that only your website can use are key features DreamHost offers with VPS hosting. This means that devoted resources will assist your website in achieving low latency and outstanding performance. 

VPS hosting has never been simple to administer because of an intuitive control panel. DreamHost also lets you personalize this control panel based on your tastes. You can also expand your RAM and storage in less than 10 seconds, providing you the comfort of knowing for when your site inevitably evolves. 

DreamPress WordPress Hosting plans start at $16.95/month.

DreamPress is the next major DreamHost pricing plan. Paying annually at $16.95 per month saves you 15%. This package offers on-demand backups, jetpack free pre-installation, and one-click staging in addition to everything in the Shared Unlimited plan. 

This plan is best suited for users who already have a WordPress website, as it is designed to work in tandem with this builder. WordPress Basic plans start at $2.59/month.

WordPress is one of the most widely used website builders on the internet. For small business WordPress users, you should look into DreamHost's WordPress options. Your site can be adequately optimized for WordPress and blogs. 

With robust features, add-ons, and 24/7 support, DreamHost WordPress hosting will entirely transform your website. They accomplish this by collaborating closely with WordPress.org, ensuring that you always get the most recent version and that your website is up and running and secure. 

Dedicated Server Hosting

A dedicated hosting plan can be fully managed for you and is suitable for high-traffic apps and websites, as well as resellers and agencies. This is the most expensive web hosting option. 

[DreamHost](https://serp.ly/dreamhost) offers a number of dedicated hosting alternatives. The Standard four plan priced at $169 per month or $149 for a yearly commitment is the most basic, with 4GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. 

The $379 per month Enhanced SSD 64 plan, which includes 64GB of RAM and 240GB of solid-state storage, is the most expensive choice. Every DreamHost dedicated server package includes unrestricted data transfers. Cloud Hosting plans start at $4.50/month.

DreamCloud is the name of Dreamhost's Cloud hosting service. DreamCloud comprises two parts: DreamCompute (a public cloud computing service) and DreamObjects (scalable storage solution). 

DreamCompute is superior to VPS since it allows you to deploy and personalize your cloud servers. In addition, you'll have a fully accessible storage service for all of your data with DreamObjects, and you'll be able to browse it at any moment. 

Cloud hosting is a great solution for customers who want to host a website using their favorite programs, run their server, play games, or run web-scale applications. DreamHost constantly places a premium on speed and performance for all servers. 

Because of next-generation processors and speedier SSD disks, cloud hosting SSH is available in 30 seconds.

## Server Speed and Uptime

Nobody appreciates a sluggish website. A quicker website is essential for improving user experience and SEO. WPBeginner's speed test revealed that their DreamHost test site loaded in less than half a second, which is fantastic. 

However, because their test site receives no visitors, this test does not provide a comprehensive view. DreamHost stayed available throughout the test even when there was a large volume of traffic. However, as the number of users increased, so did the response time. 

Their test site received 97 queries per second, totaling 16,000 requests with an average response time of 77 milliseconds.

Another criterion for determining a hosting provider's reliability is uptime. During testing, WPBeginner's test site did not go down. Therefore, they activated the downtime tracker since some hosting servers frequently fail throughout stress tests.

## Security and Backups

DreamHost offers antispam protection for its email and yet no malware detection security. On a brighter note, DreamHost focuses on other aspects of website security. The control panel includes an easy-to-find option for changing the '.htaccess' file to control site access or create a password. 

You can stop spiders from indexing areas of your site that should not be indexed by search engines. Cron jobs (automatic batch jobs) can be used to schedule tasks and monitor site processes. 

DreamHost also provides free secure-socket-layer (SSL) certificates, which are essential for anyone selling stuff online. DreamHost performs a daily backup of your website, and you may also do a manual backup once a day. 

Backups are kept by DreamHost for up to two weeks. You can restore a backup from your panel if necessary. On the Backup Your Account page, you'll find the 'One-Click' backup option in your panel. 

This is a straightforward method for backing up your complete account, along with all users, databases, and mailboxes.
