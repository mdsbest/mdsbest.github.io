## Overview

They previously offered several hosting packages like shared, Virtual Private Server or VPS hosting, and dedicated hosting. Right now, they focus on one hosting plan and pack it with features ranging from website building, SEO, security, and many more.

![](/images/This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is 19615d6d-1f89-4431-84f4-699d452187c2.png)

## Getting Started with StartLogic

Opening the StartLogic page for the first time, I was greeted by a page where you can see the features of their web hosting plan, a domain name registration box, and features of their site builder.

![](/images/This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is 901cfc5b-cd0f-45f8-b287-d2a5e8e5b825.png)

While browsing the StartLogic page, I noticed that they only offer a single shared web hosting plan called StartLogic Pro. Many other hosting companies offer more hosting options than StartLogic is currently offering. Startlogic Pro costs $59.88 for one year, $83.76 for two years, and $99 for three years of hosting package. The regular rate is $5.50 per month. For this StartLogic review, I have no other choice but to try the Pro plan.

This plan comes with a free domain name, free email address, free marketing tools, drag-and-drop site builder, mobile-friendly templates, and unlimited domains. The $2.75 cost is only applicable if you buy a plan equivalent to three years.

To get started, I clicked the button that said: "Build Your Website Now!".

![](/images/This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is bd1d64e1-5912-4b94-b593-61e71e37a628.png)

I chose to register a new domain name, but an option to transfer an existing domain name from other domain registrars is also available. After checking my domain name's availability, I fill in the registration page asking for the contact information, payment information, and purchase information. Payment method options are credit cards or PayPal. For credit cards, input the card number, security code, expiration month, and year.

![](/images/This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is 4cf2e522-9499-440b-8647-9f8a15cffdd0.png)

I selected my preferred billing cycle in the purchase information box and added a Domain Privacy + Protection that costs $9.99 per year. This add-on will protect the customers' identity from unwanted exposures that could lead to identity theft, spam, stalkers, etc.

Choosing a more extended billing period could save you a lot since the monthly cost is cheaper. Instant activation is already included in your plan with no setup fee. This plan also comes with a free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt SSL.

![](/images/This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is 43de877d-fd40-4c4e-b777-0a65da0b108c.png)

Another essential part of the sign-up process is the add-ons that StartLogic offers. It is dubbed as website essentials and includes WordPress Optimization, Website Builder, Website Security, Google Workspace, and SiteBackup and Restore.

![](/images/This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is 6fe012a9-5ea7-4531-ae4e-5b3ba337807c.png)

Overall, my total cost amounts to $233.65 for a three-year hosting duration—quite a leap from the $2.75 that the [StartLogic](https://serp.ly/startlogic) page advertized. A welcome message was sent to my email address after the confirmation and validation of my payment.

## Using and Managing Your Website with StartLogic

To manage your website and hosting account, you need to log into your StartLogic dashboard.

![](/images/This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is a49ec228-f5a2-43fe-aa4b-51bd29f27a82.png)

The StartLogic dashboard has a pretty clean and straightforward interface. It has the following tabs:

Domain Tab

This tab displays all active and expired domains. It shows the name, expiration date, privacy, renewal status, webmail access, and setting. On this page, buttons to purchase domain and import domain are also available. Clicking the Manage button of the domain name will open the page that shows the domain settings, information, privacy and information, email accounts, and many more.

## StartLogic Control Panel

StartLogic control panel used to look like a cPanel dashboard where tools are arranged according to functions. But, a few years ago, it started making some changes by integrating these tools into the StartLogic foundation dashboard.

Here are some of the tabs in StartLogic's control panel:

Account Settings Tab

The page lets you edit your contact information, personal site profile, current plan, notification settings, and many more.

## StartLogic WordPress Themes

Aside from WebsiteBuilder, [StartLogic](https://serp.ly/startlogic) also supports WordPress in making your website. WordPress is perhaps the most commonly used content management system available in the market today.

The WordPress themes and plugins determine the website functions and how site visitors interact with the page and contents. StartLogic has compiled a shortlist of themes to recommend to its customers. Here are some of them:

Highend

## StartLogic Customer Support

Customer support and technical support are other factors that someone looking for a web host must consider before purchasing a plan. Having an expert support team to help the customer with any difficulties and issues encountered is a feature that any web host should prioritize.

While browsing the StartLogic website, I encountered problems finding some information about the plan I am interested in. So, I contacted their support team via live chat and inquired about the control panels used and the hosting package features that they offered.

The response to the first question was pretty quick, but they never answered my other questions until such time that the chat closed due to inactivity. I opened another chat to ask the same question, and the same thing happened. Some of the answers I got from the live chat are inconsistent with what is on their website.

![](/images/This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is e13fa098-7d33-4f0b-a5dc-2b404941daed.png)

Aside from the live chat support, they also support phone and email help. I also checked the articles from their knowledge base to see if I could find answers to my queries, but it turned out to be just as confusing. Some of the articles are not updated, while others lack enough information to explain things, especially on the list of hosting services that they offered.

![](/images/This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is 399e9156-ac02-4dd4-a76d-25d35a0f865b.png)

In conclusion, my experience with the Startlogic support is not as good as my experience with other hosting providers.

## Buyer's Guide for StartLogic

Security for your website and your domain is vital in choosing a web host. This feature is vital for shared hosting packages where server resources are being shared across different users.

## Final Thoughts

Among the other hosting provider that started from the same decade as [Startlogic](https://serp.ly/startlogic), it seems that StartLogic has shown a decline in performance. While other web hosting companies grow bigger with their hosting plans, Startlogic seems to be doing the opposite, starting from poor customer service to selling most of its security features.

Overall, my experience with Startlogic was not as lovely as the other web hosts I have reviewed. But that is only my experience, which does not necessarily represent the other website owners. Nevertheless, it has everything you need to put your site online for an affordable price.

As a piece of advice, make comprehensive research and comparisons of the web hosting providers you are choosing from. In addition, it is also best to read the reviews from customers and take note of the negative reviews. Call the technical and software support to ask what actions they have done to address these issues.

I hope this StartLogic review helped you in your web hosting journey!
