## FastComet Walkthrough

[FastComet](https://serp.ly/fastcomet)Â is one of the best web hosting providers available on the market today. Web hosts help website owners manage their websites effectively and efficiently by ensuring it stays online all the time, secured, and has sufficient storage space. FastComet is not new to the hosting industry. It has been running since 2013 and continuously providing web hosting services to over 50,000 personal and small-business website owners from different parts of the world. It has 11 enterprise-class data centers scattered across the continents, including the previously difficult-to-reach parts like India and Australia.

![FastComet 11 enterprise-class data centers](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/SNvoZViNpl4LEr2EQDJG44UBuJswXM_LaqECjzi6b4LLSvmonbieYtGf54v6yLyPJ4WlPufqaVsFojZm3hLkuN2l4osORa63PEhw2F263SmFo-ihDhbAGGL4STS1PDiDYoeO-gUhYuCxqBVMXthErW4)

_FastComet 11 enterprise-class data centers_

It is rated excellent by more than 1,000 FastComet reviews from TrustPilot and hailed as the number one web hosting company by the HostAdvice community from around 60,000 authentic user reviews. FastComet also received numerous recognitions from HostAdvice: Best Customer Service, Excellent Service Award, Best Shared Host, and User's Top Choice.

When you visit [FastComet](https://serp.ly/fastcomet), you will be greeted with a colorful homepage. From here, you can navigate the home tabs to see the different services offered, plans and pricing, technologies used, smart control panel, and the page about its humble beginnings. You can also see the shared hosting plans and all cloud VPS's & dedicated servers. Aside from that, you can also see a head-to-head comparison between FastComet and other web hosting companies. Checking out these comparisons is a good idea before you start deciding on a plan.

![screenshot of FastComet dashboard](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/27Fl9jUk4tLMYm3DA4VBivjJWBnQejZZzOeXbnDNQ3EkhHZ1dRJDUO7KXl8sBAVHcoKrPiyjPcoFMi2Dn-Jg7qiyqwgWHYC1_AlLmt8-4BkimIeNseQHX2YCRlnIx7OMoXLMKcIqlx2uvG7_n_ulrPo)

FastComet services include Web hosting, WordPress hosting, domain management, WooCommerse Hosting, and many more. Choose Website Hosting from the All Services tab to be directed to the plans and pricing page. Depending on your needs, you can choose from Shared Hosting Plan, Cloud VPS Hosting, and Dedicated CPU Servers. For this review, let me walk you through the most popular hosting option called the FastCloud shared hosting plan. This is the cheapest plan offered by FastComet, with a starting price of $2.95 per month. They offer a 45-day money-back guarantee for all shared accounts, which allows you to try the services for 45 days. You can cancel your plan within the 45-day grace period, and they will return the money that was deposited when you signed up. You can choose to stay in the current plan or upgrade your account, and your work will be right where you left it. They used to offer a free trial account, but the trial was cut off in 2019. When you click the "Get Started" or "Start Now" button, you will be directed to a domain registration page.

![Screenshot of FastComet domain registration page](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Jq8-NN5aTWiEf6gmctL5nr8I-_TytF_cE5DjvMO6LJdQCJW0s3s4aWjq9LaEU7-UAABlYoLF38qDkTLZSoYf7EK5qbOSCaU2WtjlyTNRTxLGw0vKwxlGxkb-FfVAjEYnOEyUo_HIAQhzUBJWbTqxMS0)

Here, you type your chosen website domain name to first see if it's available. You can either create a new domain name or register an existing one from other hosts. FastComet has a straightforward process for domain transfers coming from other hosting providers. If the domain name you input is not available, you will be asked to choose another. If your domain name is accepted, you will need to fill out your account and product information to get started. I registered my WordPress website to serve as my test site.

![FastCloud Hosting Plans-Account Information | FastComet ](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/9G5gs-H4j7k0HJ4p3tAMy-IcjdzpZ1YTloYuvJZuWL15UcVKB7EIQHtm8ZBE9RUUH8gxseV_QFQoyFTirg_ja4cx9C01SY4l6C_bHcGBIrGTIf6v9e8BhTf6pD7eWlgMFEj4j5O-dxJqRE7K8uaKVJc)

The WordPress site used for testing is relatively small. If you are a beginner like me, you can also create your own WordPress site and test it with FastComet to see how it works. Afterward, when you get some experience, you can expand and go big. If you do not mind spending a little extra on some add-ons for your website, you can select extra features in addition to the ones listed in your plan.

![FastCloud Hosting Plans-Extras| FastComet](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/lmubJC93p1aN5X2zq2Quuxhv_dBYAFrh3d2eM7cRotk8eyhCctAecWBmIZfO39dVYAu0-IxWg4oSmzAukXXk7Dfl_cphwSCk1fPzogGdCFRnBavN9pBU43WW7RKabDCGPLtvQZTDzJWWDqULA6Fr8JU)

The first two extras are automatically updated once you purchase a FastCloud plan. The other extras you can choose include Search Engine Submission, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Audit, and/or Google SiteMap. Make sure to read the descriptions before you continue. Next, you need to input your payment information to complete your order. FastComet supports either a credit card or Paypal. Make sure to review everything before you check out.

![Screenshot of FastComet Payment Information](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/FLlj-TmGAH3u3Y390wIyUlbHHnpIQR98c-PSDneQTVZr-w7oSh6K8wMpjU-h6WqXzE9BSyHcrrkfaEXlohse8fq4NxQq5_VqyDzvVGnTvTC9bgUTRGkseNS_h1fy2wX60ERfEI6a6PUzK6NSwvS9bpQ)

You are now good to go with your FastComet web hosting journey! Be sure to check the email address you registered with FastComet for a receipt on your purchase. In addition, FastComet will send you an email that contains your login details and a URL for secure access to your control panel. This will also include your temporary hosting password, which you should change through the link found in the message. Make sure to note these important hosting details so you don't have a hard time accessing them later. After this, your basic account setup is complete.

In the Register New Domain tab, you can check the availability of the free domain name you wish to use. You can also browse for domain names that are on sale. These domain names are from those that failed to renew their hosting accounts on time. If another website has already taken your chosen domain name, FastComet will suggest available, including those on sale. You can click the Select button to choose your domain from the list, then click Add to Cart to purchase. You will be directed to your shopping cart, where you can add some add-ons and finalize your payment. Once payment is confirmed and purchase is successful, the updated domain will show up under the My Domains tab.

![Screenshot of shopping cart](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/stQIZpPaNGox_bc2bgcap_Fj0nK96NWyJpgdpwHbeSGGr1B8pGmKCF865CxFGPY5HAJ-jy381xrB09qOxDAYNQhfvUyroSQ8_kX9drn0A7cMWFnDj26C4yQEuFDcv7fzsKW7wIt54_0lbe7utRaQigk)

You can check the domain name life cycle on their tutorial page to see how registering your domain works. The Renew tab under Domains allows you to renew the due date of your domain name.

In the Billings tab, you can find all your invoices for every service or product purchased. The billing section is used to pay and add funds to your account which ensures that your web hosting provider can directly deduct purchases from it. Managing your credit card details is also done here. This is where you can update your payment info.

### FastComet Customer Support

I tested [FastComet](https://serp.ly/fastcomet)'s customer support and I am honestly impressed with how fast the replies are. It took less than 10 seconds to get someone to talk to! And before you think about it - no, the replies weren't automated. I tried asking for a different mode of payment aside from using a credit card. I also received a call, an email, and a text message about my account's payment. They are really living up to their statement of 24/7/365 customer support!
