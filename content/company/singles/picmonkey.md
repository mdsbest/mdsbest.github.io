## What is PicMonkey?

[PicMonkey](https://serp.ly/picmonkey/) is an online photo editor that helps you create unique images and designs for your brand or personal use. 

It has a very user-friendly interface, making it ideal for non-designers. 

It is always up to date and requires no download. That’s a big plus! 

Although it does have an app in case you need to create a design or edit a photo on your smartphone. 

PicMonkey also features many cool artist-made templates for banners, ads, logos, business cards, and social media posts. You can start from a blank canvas as well. 

You can also add different elements like customizable graphics, text, and stock images and videos. Their libraries are pretty cool!

### What Makes PicMonkey Different?

PicMonkey also offers features that will help you keep your brand consistent. 

Nowadays, the real challenge small business owners and online entrepreneurs face is standing out from the crowd.

Creating an identity and making an impact on your niche is more challenging than it might seem. This is why Picmonkey provides essential resources like brand kits, asset management, and different collaboration tools. 

However, its incredible photo editor steals the spotlight with awesome tools to enhance your images. It allows you to retouch your pictures like a pro, without the knowledge and skills you would typically need for other photo editing programs. 

## PicMonkey Photo Editor

So let’s focus on what most users agree is PicMonkey’s best attribute. 

Similar tools might serve the same general purpose, but their photo editors tend to be rather limited and disappointing. This is exactly what makes PicMonkey worth choosing over its competitors. 

It allows you to fully customize your images in a matter of minutes. Here’s a list of what you can do with it: 

### Basic Adjustments

Crop, resize, rotate and fix the lights and colors. 

![](/images/picmonkey1.png)

Any decent tool will offer these options but in most cases, this is as far as they go.

### Advanced Edits

Just below the basics, you’ll find more advanced tools to duplicate a selected object, fix the colors, and play with the brightness, among other things.

### Effects

This is always the fun part. Just like when we’re about to post a picture on Instagram looking for the perfect filter, PicMonkey offers dozens of options.

The best thing is you can use a paintbrush to apply the effect only on the desired areas of your photo. If you mess up, just paint it back on with the eraser tool. 

There are even effects that let you change colors!

### Touch Up

Now, this is definitely something you just don’t get from any tool. I promise it will make you feel like an absolute pro.

These are some of the features you can use to give your pics a boost:

- Red-eye remover
- Teeth Whitening
- Lip tint
- Airbrush
- Digital Make up
- Blemish Fix
- Wrinkle Remover
- Shine Reducer
- Spray Tan
- Eye Color Changer

And the list goes on and on!

### Textures

Adding one of PicMonkeys textures to your design can really make a difference. It’s the artsy touch you need to take your photo to the next level. Some can make your photo look vintage, while others can give it a 3D effect.

You can add a touch of color and bring your design to life, or go for monochrome to achieve a more sophisticated aesthetic. 

Once you pick your player, you can customize it by changing the saturation, blending, and fading it according to your needs. 

Trust me, you can make your photo look exactly the way you pictured it. 

Just have fun with it! There are no wrong choices, you’re the artist here.

### Frames

Frames are the perfect finishing touch for your photos and PicMonkey knows it.

That’s why they offer various styles for you to choose from, including Polaroid Frames, Film Strips, and Shape Cutouts. 

And don’t hesitate to check out their collage templates! Those can also make great frames, especially if you need to merge two or more pictures together.

## How Much Does PicMonkey Cost?

Paying for a premium subscription will unlock all those cool features I told you about. Just like its competitors, PicMonkey offers 3 different subscription plans: Basic, Pro, and Business. 

![](/images/7.png)

### Basic 

Let’s be honest here, the Basic plan might be a bit too basic. It includes only 1GB of cloud storage and it supports JPG and PNG downloading formats.  

As an addition, it offers a few useful features like adding and trimming videos, an expansive library of top-tier fonts, and touch-up tools. 

Last but not least: effects, templates, and other elements that will come in handy when starting a new project. 

Even though there’s not a huge difference in price with the Pro version paid monthly, we have to admit that the difference becomes significant if you choose to pay annually. 

Now, if you’re looking to make a good investment in a reliable editing tool, you might as well go all in and make the most of it.

### Pro

This is the plan they recommend the most and if you keep reading you’ll see why.

The Pro version offers everything included in the Basic, plus:

- Unlimited cloud storage
- PDF downloading format
- A brand kit (an online business essential!)
- Stock images 
- Animations
- Priority email support
- The possibility to upload your own fonts
- Smart resize
- Background remover

### Business

This last plan doesn’t offer a free trial, so you better be sure this is the one you need. 

Usually, it is the plan users get after trying the previous subscriptions and deciding that the most expensive plan is going to be worth paying. 

As you might have guessed, the business plan is ideal for companies and small entrepreneurs who need collaboration tools. 

That’s basically what this upgrade is about: being able to put many hands to work on a single project. It includes several brand kits and the possibility to work in teams of 2 or more. 

By now you’ve carefully read the descriptions of each plan and reached a decision. 

Cool. 

But WAIT, not so fast!

Many users have complained about PicMonkey pricing plans not being fully transparent. 

Most people go for the free trial first, which usually involves adding a payment method to automatically charge you after the trial period, unless you cancel your subscription on time. 

This is not rare, it is actually quite standard and common to any online service. 

However, some users expected their subscription to be charged monthly and were surprised with an unexpected $120 charge on their credit cards. 

I mean, imagine forgetting to cancel the subscription to your free trial (we’ve all been there) and getting charged for a whole year of a product that didn’t even convince you in the first place. 

So I took the trouble to pretend I was gonna start my free trial. I found that there’s literally a switch to set whether you want your plan to be billed monthly or yearly, and prices change considerably.

## So, Is PicMonkey Safe?

Absolutely yes. You just need to read the terms carefully and not make any rash decisions. 

And needless to say, don’t start a free trial unless you’re aware you’re going to be charged automatically once the trial period is over. 

## PicMonkey App

At this point, you might have a clear idea of how the browser version works, but that’s not all. PicMonkey also offers the possibility to edit pictures on the go with their mobile app. 

Any company should be aware that most of the time people spend online is using a smartphone instead of a computer. 

This chart illustrates the daily internet usage per capita worldwide from 2011 to 2021, by device: 

![](/images/10.png)

Today, mobile internet usage has tripled desktop internet usage. I don’t know about you, but I can’t say I’m surprised. 

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/scrolling.webp)

This is why it is crucial for any online business or software to have a strong mobile presence and offer reliable on-the-go solutions to their users. 

PicMonkey App is supported by both iOS and Android devices and features monthly updates. 

The app has pretty much the same functionalities as the web version, although it includes some additional templates for social media stories. 

![](/images/11.png)

Usually, when a photo editor launches a mobile version it tends to be more limited than the desktop or online versions, but that’s not the case here. 

The PicMonkey App is just as good as the browser version, so that’s a huge advantage. 

## PicMonkey Alternatives 

This article contains pretty much everything you need to know. So if you’re still unsure, it might be a good idea to check out other editors and compare their features. 

Let me give you some ideas. 

### [Canva](https://serp.ly/canva/) 

![](/images/12-1024x423.png)

[Canva’s](https://devinschumacher.com/review/canva//) photo editor is actually way more limited than PicMonkey’s. 

However, if you need professional-looking graphic solutions fast and easy, Canva will most likely have what you’re looking for. It is mainly aimed at designing banners, business cards, logos, etc.  

Its interface is pretty similar to PicMonkey’s, making it as easy to use, if not easier. It features countless templates, formats, elements, and fonts. You can create the most sophisticated designs in a matter of minutes.  

One advantage [Canva has over PicMonkey](https://devinschumacher.com/canva-vs-picmonkey/) that we can’t overlook is that the free version already provides everything you’ll need to get started. No need to pay for a subscription unless you want to unlock the fancier features. 

### GIMP

![](/images/13.png)

If you’re not willing to invest money, you might want to check out this free open-source photo editing software. 

This is not one of those all-in-one tools that will magically turn you into a graphic designer, but it does the trick when it comes to editing. 

It doesn’t have any templates, which means you will have to do all the work. This might make it a bit harder to use, but it is still user-friendly and requires no previous knowledge. 

Another thing to point out is that GIMP is only available for Windows. Bummer!

### [Adobe Spark](https://serp.ly/spark-by-adobe/)

![](/images/14.png)

Speaking of free tools, Adobe Spark is another great alternative. 

Unline GIMP, Spark does have a generous variety of templates and designs at your disposal completely free of charge. 

Users like to describe it as Photoshop’s user-friendly counterpart. If you’re already familiar with other Adobe tools you will probably feel very comfortable with its interface. 

It also has a mobile version, which is pretty cool. But we also have to talk about the cons and Adobe Spark has a big one: all your edits will have that annoying Adobe watermark on the bottom corner. 

By the way, no one said you have to choose one. You can easily combine them depending on what you need at the moment. These 3 alternatives are either free or offer a free version so there’s no need to commit. 

What most users like to do is use PicMonkey as their go-to editor and resort to the others when they need something different. 

Now it’s your turn to try them out and decide which one is best for you. 

Pro tip: keep your options open!

But do me a favor... Do not buy from Adobe.

They will never stop charging you. Ever.

It's literally impossible to get them to stop charging you.

Impossible.

_**Legal Disclaimer**: "Impossible" is hyperbole, and aforementioned opinions about Adobe are just that - opinions. And also meant purely as satire. I make no official claim to the ease or difficulty of cancelling subscriptions with Adobe._

## Final Thoughts

PicMonkey is one of the most popular online photo editors mainly because it combines practicality and quality.

If I were to describe PicMonkey in 3 words, they would be: easy to use, fast results, and cheap prices. 

You can’t really ask for more than that. 

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying the other alternatives are bad or there is something inherently wrong with them (or PicMonkey for that matter). It all boils down to personal preferences and what you need.
