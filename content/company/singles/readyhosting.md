## Customer Feedback

It is always difficult to find the right hosting solution. It truly is a forest full of trees out there. I needed only three things: 1. Lots of space 2. ASP hosting 3. A low price. ReadyHosting beats most competitors on pricing and makes up with good service and a wonderful hosting package. Easily my hoster of choice.

“All I can say is great! I've been using your firm since December 7th, 2000. To say I was dissatisfied with the service I had from my former host would be an understatement. Their customer service representatives were haughty and conceited. They refused to recognize that their network was constantly malfunctioning, and they were unable to fix it. Customer service was unfamiliar to several of the younger tech support staff. After 20 years in the military and more than five years out of the service, customer service has always been important to me.”. -Babak Fakhamzadeh 

“It has been a pleasure working with your team at ReadyHosting. This firm has elevated my status to that of an equal to the CEO's. You can tell your business cares about its clients, in my opinion. It has been a while since I've had to deal with any of these people, but I'm sure there are more. They've all been wonderful to work with. I sent a buddy to your site, and he ended up signing up with you. In order to express my gratitude, I would like you to personally thank each of the employees listed above and their supervisors as well.” -Guy L. Strupper 

“ReadyHosting has provided me with excellent service. Technical assistance has been excellent, as has the installation process itself, which was quick and painless. On Sunday night at 9PM, I received an email answer from tech support in response to a query I had emailed them over the weekend. Everyone I know will be using this service in the future. ReadyHosting is an excellent company with outstanding service and reasonable cost.” -Scott Schoenherr

“The first thing to note is that I spent a lot of time looking for a web server. This decision was difficult because there are so many great offers out there. I opted to host Future Gamez with ReadyHosting for some reason or another. ReadyHosting is fast enough for the graphics-intensive Future Gamez, which features previews and reviews of upcoming console titles. A week online and I've had zero issues with www.futuregamez.net, and my readers are raving about how quickly the site now downloads. I can't say enough good things about this web server.” -David Warner

“My seventh website has just gone up on ReadyHosting. I had a tiny issue, but it was fixed within 30 minutes by Tech Support. It is a testament to how pleased I am with ReadyHosting's great service and knowledgeable employees that I have continued to migrate and establish new websites on your platform after more than a year. Thank you very much for your outstanding service and dedication to delivering the best Web hosting & reseller alternatives.” -Henry Caine
