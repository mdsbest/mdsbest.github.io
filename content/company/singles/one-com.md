Denmark-based web hosting company [One.com](https://serp.ly/one-com) was founded in 2002 by Jacob Jensen.

## WordPress vs.Website Builder

### Ease of use

WordPress, on the other hand, is considered to be more difficult to use. This is simply because WordPress might be too much for newbies to deal with. Despite this, WordPress isn't inherently complicated in its interface. WordPress also uses more specialized terminology.

Additionally, it has a higher period of adjustment than a site builder, making it significantly more complex than a website builder. It's easy to use WordPress if you get the swing of it. When it comes to creating a stunning website, there's no better time than now.

Using a site builder is a good option if you don't want to spend a lot of time learning about how to design a website from scratch. Creating a website has never been so simple. The intuitive drag-and-and-drop interface simplifies website creation.

There are free images available on our Site Builder at one.com. Not having to shoot your own photos will save you even more time. 

### Flexibility 

Create any type of website, from a blog site to a company site, using WordPress or a website builder. You'll have a lot more freedom and options with WordPress, though. First and foremost, WordPress has a huge selection of plugins (add-ons). 

These are extensions that may be used to enhance your website's functionality. In addition, many add-ons are free to download and use. However, because plugins are additional extensions to your website, adding the incorrect ones might have a negative impact on your site.

Checking the number of reviews installed, and most recent update dates should always be a part of the process before putting something new into service. WordPress, on the other hand, has hundreds of free themes to pick from instead of the one.com Website Builder's 140 designs. Other website builders may not be mobile-friendly by default, but that isn't necessarily true of WordPress.

Content on your website will automatically adjust to fit the screen size of the visitor. The good news is that every template on one.com is responsive right out of the box. Using our Website Builder, you can ensure that your website appears fantastic on all devices.

Every one of our templates may be customized to your exact specifications after you've chosen one of them. You will have a lot more options and greater flexibility with WordPress, but the process of making custom changes can be more challenging.

### Manageability

Fiddling around' is a common term used in WordPress. For your website to be visually appealing, you'll need to set aside some free time. It doesn't matter if you're using WordPress or a website builder to publish your content. Nevertheless, WordPress is a superior choice if you intend to publish a large volume of material and grow your website over time.

For those who simply need to get their website online and keep it simple, though, a Website Builder may be the best option. When it comes to getting your site online, a website builder is a great option. If you're looking to build a larger website, publish more material, and have a lot of options, WordPress is the best option for you.

### Properly Crafted Templates

The templates they provide have a clean, modern look and feel. Wedding websites, restaurants, performances, freelancers, and organizations all have their own specific design templates in this category! Some layouts are geared for creatives, such as marketing companies, photographers, and painters.

### Simpleness of Use

With One.com's drag-&-drop website builder, it's not just the template that you have to work with. Utilizing clearly labeled instruments and coding options abound on the user-friendly interface. It's included with all shared hosting plans, except for WordPress ones.

## A Guide to Using the Online Marketplace Creator to Start Your Own Online Business

Using [One.com](https://serp.ly/one-com)'s online shop generator, any website (even WordPress blogs!) can get up and running with selling products within only a few short minutes. The internet store builder, on the other hand, is a paid service for hosting clients.

The cost of One.com's online shop creators ranges from $12 to $14, according to whether you're using WordPress or another content management system (which is pricier). This subscription includes extra features including increased storage, one-click WordPress installation, and backup/restore. 

Features include: 

- Premium templates  

- Fully featured online shop

- Unlimited pages 

- Free images 

- Ability to process credit card transactions

- SSL certificate

- Responsive mobile design 

## One.com CPanel

As an alternative to the more widely used cPanel, One.com employs a proprietary control panel. With a bespoke control panel, we don't know if we'll like it or not until we use it. Depending on the host, you may find a user-friendly and inventive control panel on one host, or a frustrating and complicated one on another.

Fortunately, One.com provides a user-friendly personalized control panel for its customers. From the dashboard, you can manage your account information, files, security, domains, and more.

## One.com Website Builder  

Using One.com's website builder, you don't need to know how to code. Instead of creating a mobile-friendly site from scratch, you use pre-made templates. 

## Domain Names 

One unrestricted domain name is included in all plans. If you wish to use a bigger hosting package to host more than one website, you will need to acquire extra domain names. 

Customers may select from over 250 domain extensions, such as .com, .academy, .info, .digital, and .dk, which are all available. Starting at $10, some of the most unusual extensions have a higher price tag.

## Starting an E-Commerce Business using Online Store Creator

Using One.com's online shop generator, any website (even WordPress blogs!) can get up and running with selling products within only a few short minutes. The internet store builder, on the other hand, is a paid service for hosting clients.

The cost of One.com's online shop creators ranges from $12 to $14, according to whether you're using WordPress or another content management system (which is pricier). This subscription includes extra features including increased storage, one-click WordPress installation, and backup/restore. 

Features include:

- Premium templates  

- Fully featured online store

- Unlimited pages 

- Free images 

- Ability to process credit card transactions

- SSL certificate

- Responsive mobile design 

## Hosting Options for WordPress

In addition to the normal shared hosting plans offered by One.com, which we will examine in more detail later, there are three WordPress-specific packages available as well.

Unlimited websites and email accounts are included in each of the 3 One.com WordPress hosting plans in addition to a 1-click WordPress installation and an SSL certificate.

## One.com Customer Support 

One.com provides round-the-clock customer service in a variety of languages. As a matter of fact, the company's website is available in 14 languages!

## Chat and Email Support

One.com provides live chat assistance as a basic feature in the website hosting market. In addition, an email address is provided for contacting customer service through email.

In addition, they offer a comprehensive knowledge base that includes FAQs and "Top 5 Guides." In most cases, we could simply type in our question and get an answer.

The absence of live phone assistance doesn't bother me because One.com isn't built for high-performance websites. However, several of our customers have expressed dissatisfaction with our customer service.

## Pricing and Plans

Four shared hosting options are available from One.com: 

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/yByFGv8bNd_vdE7-EktxQP5PAyXB9JAEs84mdkXMSJVoMYhfQ34zqc8z6WTABKcvCFQ-oUj6gtDj4StAgXEu3ueO_uUE9AGblxLe4EfGsyXmGzwL-1lfdN5yDjSkOsji5-9pqFis_sUC4f7FSr3VNDA)

All shared hosting plans include a free-of-charge domain during the first year, an SSL certificate, a free website builder, everyday backups, and a $150 credit for Google Ads. 

Additionally, the following other sorts of plans exist:

- From $2.49 a month, you may host your own email account (similar to shared hosting)

- The monthly cost of WordPress hosting is as low as $3.99

Starting at just $2.49 a month, One.com's beginning costs are fairly reasonable. For starters, the lowest package is $5.49/month, however these changes after your free trial time expires (twice the primary price). If you want to pay for One.com annually, you'll have to shell out a large sum of money upfront because there is no monthly payment option.

Is There a Money-Back Guarantee for One.com?

There is a money-back guarantee on One.com's products. Requesting a refund within 15 days of purchasing your One.com order is the only way to secure a complete refund. To get your money back, send an email to their customer service department. In the event of a cancellation, you should seek a refund, not a refund.

As a result, they are addressed differently. Please keep in mind that you may only take advantage of this full refund once. However, domain registration charges will not be included in the refund, but the "web space" and setup fee will. The policy of your web host should be familiar to you before signing up.

## Domain Pricing and Discounts

Compared to other businesses, they don't give a large discount in the first year of a domain name. Renewal rates, on the other hand, are comparable to those of competing brands.

Late Renewal Fees

Be on the lookout for any changes to your domain name. There are no penalty costs for renewing it within the first five days of its expiration. A "redemption" cost will be added to the renewal price if you miss the five-day window, but you'll still have 25 days to do it.

According on the length of the extension, the expenses for redemption might range from $25 to $80. This is in contrast to GoDaddy, a low-cost web server, which provides you a grace period of 18 days. There is no "redemption fee" throughout this 18-day period when you can renew your terminated domain.

## One.com Server Speed

### Uptime 

One.com met the industry requirement of 99.93 percent uptime during our most recent testing session with a strong 99.95 percent uptime. However, in the previous 12 months, their uptime has dropped to 99.78%, which is a significant decrease.

It took 19 hours to repair the damage caused by the ten outages. If January's bad uptime of 97.39 percent hadn't dragged down the entire average, One.com's uptime would have been an excellent 99.99 percent.

### Page Load Speed

Updated mobile page performance benchmarks for corporations have been released by Google. Basically, they looked at millions of websites and connected the results to the behavior of visitors to see how fast they were loading.

A site that takes more than 3 seconds to load leaves 53% of mobile web users frustrated. Upon reflection, this makes perfect sense, doesn't it? When you're surfing on your phone, three seconds feels like a lifetime. Sadly, this is the saddest part.

According to their findings, the typical page loading time was nearer to 15 seconds. Nearly five times longer. 

## Security and Backups

Your web domain, databases, email accounts, & Website Builder projects can all be backed up and restored with Backup & Restore. The Control Panel is where you'll find it. It's possible to restore your web space, database, and email messages up to two weeks in the past using the backups.

There are a number of ways you may access a backup, including restoring it, downloading it to your computer, or storing it in your online space.

Your web space's disk space will be used when you save a copy there. There is no limit to the number of times you may restore your Website Builder Projects. We have the ability to preserve up to 200 different versions of your site.

## Pros

- Free-of-charge domain for the first year

- Available WordPress hosting options

- Very affordable shared hosting plans

- An easy-to-use site builder is free with all non-WordPress hosting plans

- Support is available in 14 languages including Spanish, English, Dutch, Polish, French, Italian, etc.

- Unlimited email account hosting

- 15-day money-back guarantee

## Cons

- No Windows hosting 

- Support is only available through online chat

- Limited options to upgrade plans if your site grows too large

- Only shared hosting plans (No VPS, dedicated, or cloud hosting options)

## Conclusion

[One.com](https://serp.ly/one-com) made a solid start. They had a decent website load time. Despite the company's global reach, the support choices were quick, which is commendable given the company's size.

While its uptime isn't poor overall, it was below average in January 2021. Additionally, we appreciated the inclusion of an SSL certificate and website builder in the package. 

People with minimal traffic and modest budgets may find One.com to be the perfect option for their hosting requirements. Despite their low prices and lack of advanced capabilities, they do not provide much in the way of extras.

Some limitations (expensive renewal costs; restricted features; 15-day money-back guarantee) prevented us from giving One.com the seal of approval we were hoping for.
