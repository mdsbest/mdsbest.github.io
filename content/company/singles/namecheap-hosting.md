## Namecheap Walkthrough

The [Namecheap](https://serp.ly/namecheap-hosting) hosting company, best known as a domain registrar in its early stages, started in 2000 by providing domain registration and services to the public. They evolved to offer more services such as web hosting services, security services, WordPress management, and more. They are committed to making the digital future better for its users with three data centers located in the US, UK, and EU.

Right now, there are over 1700 Namecheapers scattered across the globe, with over 13 million domains under its management and an overall satisfaction rate of 4.7 out of 5 based on over 2 million reviews. This hosting company is certainly not new to the market; it is quite older than most hosting companies and domain registrars. So what type of web hosting service can you expect?

## Getting Started With Namecheap

To get started, go to the [Namecheap](https://serp.ly/namecheap-hosting) website. When the window opens, you can see this colorful homepage. From the home tabs, you'll see the services offered, sign up and sign in tabs, promos, and more.

You can choose from an array of services: buying a domain name by using a domain name generator, website hosting & managed WordPress hosting options, shared hosting, VPS hosting, cloud hosting, dedicated servers hosting, professional emails, SSL certificates for security, and applications to boost your site. Click the Home tab to see more about their offers.

![screenshot of namecheap dashboard](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/XBr4F5Um0IJgUTml8xw7-t3zPTSoGNxifaQkAEytTizCZWBbZlCdJqNg7fi3gJT2Ua909-0DK2j-azHrR1u3taDaZRO7Qm8vUE40qDjNZ61U423cHgE4Udf5h6HCM71PKJEjHwmjpUl6kygwS-Yscys)

For this review, I chose to try their shared hosting package. Clicking the Hosting tab takes me to the following page. I like the way they divide their web hosting plans by the user's level of experience. Here you can see options for the:

- Online beginner -ideal for setting up your personal website or blog

- Small business-for solo entrepreneurs or web developers

- Large businesses -excellent for a website with so much traffic that it requires very high-performance hosting servers and lots of server resources

![screenshot of namecheap featured page](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a8bkGYXwjV_toyF_u44YHbo8qbq_U4kwn6oN_uJLautnW4LOFuIP1JqMqf61cdsXMZmr7-o1NLUI2Ln7m9rHp7whi2xB69WJviUXzGDRmLP6XygfWCXIwS6A13qFR81iNddAZt_wsVaBvFVhNQ5aYGE)

I signed up for an account under shared hosting to see how the account management works in their actual dashboard. All you have to input is the following: username, password, your name, and your email address. Many hosting companies require credit card information but not Namecheap; you won't have to input your credit card info just yet.

The sign-up process took less than a minute to complete. A welcome message will be sent to your email account. When I tried signing in to my account from another device, it sent me another email with a verification code.

## Using and Managing Your Website on Namecheap

After the sign-up process, you will be redirected to your account dashboard. You can find the services, account management, shopping cart, and account information tabs here. Here is the screen I was greeted with.

![screenshot of namecheap account dashboard](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/JiTHvBEUSf-hhFbxkYgYv1wkWUIGaCxdkNnPQCIjI_kR7S1ok4qudaBMpThjrW5HGabJBq-ylRAubem8usdrh1wW7sghA92_ugOCRdaraFaOo3w-XrclTZPSKvXU6eNUiC4yJZuZJaj2NnvN70bdJMc)

I clicked the Hosting tab and chose online beginner plans. I choose the Stellar Web Hosting plan because it is good for personal use, not to mention that it is cheaper than the rest of the plans. It can host up to three websites where I can use my own CMS. I can also access a website builder, application, and email solution. Next, I will need to choose a domain name, so I am directed to this page where I can register a new one or use an existing one from other web hosts.

![namecheap registration page](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/lpDGSdMJDTzAFa5vDbVkY88nq3QNK7E7StHve5OKU9k6Js3Z1ibL8AgPZN_sZV3jrdoDHdfDOfu5RL_w7lsIbm5zxfr08zsxawZ4C5pmmgkc6q-9ZEKVDYMdKlENl0kfRclIAbR819vV89xkrr1EQfw)

The first domain name I input was taken, so I had to choose another one. The second one I chose was accepted, so I added it to my hosting plan then added it to my cart. My assigned data center is from the US.

![screenshot of namecheap add to cart page](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/yBRxwPnzSX0QmBcRqHpIzPlIbEL1DKdMfxPkwOHAWJ0YxBNcYU6YrqPicZhROJ_pmKCdrI0txSmcPH4mB0PA9BCiU_6X71fasqM7g-NBmSv2Ds-dhESItuw_0jCHxOtLJ5pr-2k4wSsq515PqN-lTg4)

Here, I can customize my order regarding the length of subscription, renewal, security, and email. I did not enable the PremiumDNS for now. Once you are done reviewing your order, you can click the confirm button to proceed to payment.

![screenshot of namecheap account info tab](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dM9cQ7DvZgheZaEKYOgRHG5To1RWGOP0AIb4ifQ3ol5WJNyppoSlAQWWRwaIyTPuEOywseJBjNFK3WwCPaoctGlJS32xZilGTVkEkYXzUgK-zJwzzLYAmyQl7wQlBjsnqqm21u6_uU4JBQtZbLGazP4)

Here, you have to input your account contact information, Whois Account information, and payment method (VISA, MasterCard, or Paypal) before you check out. You will receive the receipt of the order after payment. Afterward, make sure to verify your contact information like email and contact number, then choose a two-factor authentication method.

### Services Tabs

These are the tabs found on the upper portion of the dashboard: Domain, Hosting, WordPress, Email, Apps, Security, Transfer, and Help Center. The Domains, Hosting, WordPress, Emails, Security, Transfer tabs will redirect site visitors to the page containing the plans, prices, features, freebies, FAQs, and disclaimers. You can browse each plan to see what satisfies you regarding the digital business hosting provider.

### Account Management Tabs

![screeshot of namecheap Account Management Tab](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/8zU53xWy_BfzG8ZJY5qixkGe876Qo7xW9nZAMK9x0k6ItoOWJU6loJ7xihziiBIT2Tq2C2Iw9o1jX3LFIPeBSSG6dKM5RhRMwJ43jYHRrEEK5jbZS_9lEkU183pcz1VqJepbdazUTgAW1mpa1tMt2Ls)

- The Dashboard tab shows your account homepage. This is the first thing you see when logging in to your account.

- The Expiring/ Expired tab shows your purchased status. Here, you'll find the domain, products, DNS & security attached, the status of their validity, expiration date, and the renewal price. There's also a View Cart button.

- The Domain List tab will show all the domains you managed under the Namecheap domain management and the hosting service.

- The Hosting list shows all your Namecheap hosting plans.

- The Private Email tab shows all email management services if you purchased a plan.

- The SSL Certificates tab shows your certificate purchases. It takes time to install after payment, so you have to wait before it is validated.

![Screenshot of Namecheap SSL Certificate tab](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/NGI8ihPV_EjqLy9i9zrFPzxFEVvXQ8jn9hHWVLDzTvefaOqXz2vaC0euCcJHImE0iSBF3Y7WNjoQVbAKfaF2NRinQaLxFZ3YmB_eQxnmIxYJ0ts74cgpPB5XfUor9uLNaYESiNDhcpU24vtoOqhjd3s)

- The Apps tab shows all the applications you can buy or install for free. Since my account is new there are no apps yet, but you can easily purchase and install them from within your dashboard. Apps include site builder, WordPress, Google Workspace, and many more. I downloaded a Namecheap website uptime monitoring app because it's free.

- The Profile tab has your personal, security, and billing information.

We are now ready to check out the Namecheap control panel!

## Namecheap CPanel

A control panel or cPanel is used to manage your website. It is a web hosting control panel software developed by cPanel, LLC, which provides a graphical interface and automation tools designed to simplify hosting a website.

Many hosting companies offer cPanel alongside their web hosting plans. It has different sections that are arranged accordingly based on function.

The cPanel also provides general information and account statistics. You can access your cPanel by going to the Hosting List tab in the dashboard and then clicking the Go To cPanel button.

## Namecheap Website Builder

Buying a web hosting plan from the [Namecheap](https://serp.ly/namecheap-hosting) web host gives you access to a website builder such as Canva, WordPress, and Web Builder. All these give you access to create a professional-looking website with themes that are easy to use, even for beginners.

### Apps Installer

![screenshot of namecheap apps installer](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ygpqmUGH3Q7hBioUCl5IrdJP2ODAJkEQsi-wIg_l6WplgchoYB2gf_Zjy1GYPaly9rvyALNOXqZ1YBREOUmyZ_7Wy6vgVgfCJkX17PR18KX7wCWZH3RcAyqLTLwme697rYK6e9aR_l5DIqpaLW_S9-Y)

From within the Namecheap cPanel, you can use the Softaculous App Installer to download apps. Choose from a wide list of applications, blogs, portals/CMS, Forums, image galleries, Wikis, Social Networking, ad management, calendars, gaming, emails, project management, e-commerce, and more.

### WordPress Themes

When you install the WordPress website manager using the Softaculous App Installer, you can choose from many different themes, from various categories.

Creating a website from scratch is also possible. WordPress plans offered by Namecheap are cheaper than with other web hosting providers and allow for easy migration.

![screenshot of namecheap wordpress themes](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CoUv6srgHm7N9LUbUagNH_XeICY4wLkIVK7z9tD9mcOqiefCEzie2bECsgjHFebTwsVBuHqYMojWfUs8QYjtKCXpvdirnDRYe_VI2VrczTqXeAUSJ-w52vEW4hzvAux_u2Sgeb-0PJHIIUvFvq65v2U)

## Namecheap Customer Support

Namecheap advertised 24/7 customer support for its user, so I put it to the test.

### Live Chat Support

The button for live chat support is located at the bottom of every Namecheap site. When I clicked the button, this is what I received. No support was readily available. I hadn't encountered this issue with other hosting providers so it was slightly concerning, however, it could very well be possible that they receive a very high number of support tickets and inquiries.

![screenshot of namecheap Live Chat Support page](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/F95f9Qel-LAxtFK_soU5QSfRklQ2kDIrUcUySpzBs8CHOCUH-zfH6NLA9ROHAA8du_TE5QnCy3t8-k6h2L0M47mNvJidObvvPWCQDCHOb2r4oUFsLoGBGKfhYk7cUvHKBAbA5-fQV0DR_bZ9rPhCtMU)

### Submit a Ticket

Another option was to get help from the Submit a Ticket feature. I submitted a ticket about having issues with my app. When submitting a ticket, your support pin is needed. You can find the support pin tab when you click your account name in the upper-left portion of the dashboard. I received an email about my request right after I submitted the ticket, but no real help was actually given. 

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HjV7vjq2xqPvX0GUPlFoh7RD8OEhAcCtMzLoAR371EiPcdAV3rmSd4ZTktnOQYXA1omfZwWZ3HN-1jiiRI2d9IiHSahSeXDcpWmt9UQMhTEQ2GCIJ1VbVEIsGjzryODXmtTwXAb-bN3hyVFFkKZL1_4)

I tried Live Chat support again after several hours. Unfortunately, no one came back to me. Guess there's no priority support to be found here.

## Security and Backups

Going online puts your site and its user at serious risk by threats from cybercriminals. That is why it is important to choose a hosting company that takes safety and security seriously. To answer this demand of utmost security, Namecheap offers the following security services: FastVPN FastVPN hides your IP address so no one can see your real location and stops anyone from tracking and stealing your password over wifi. It will not collect, track, or share any of your browsing activity.

FastVPN allows you to download confidential & sensitive files, shop, and pay online without worrying that your information will be leaked. In addition, FastVPN allows you to access international websites & watch international shows, sports, and TVs with unlimited bandwidth and speed. Plus, it works on any of your devices. Namecheap offers a plan for this that is 100% off for the first month and renews at $5.88 per month.

Domain Privacy Protection (Withheld for Privacy) Namecheap partnered with Withheld for Privacy to offer free lifetime protection for your domain. It keeps the domain owner's contact information out of a public database.

This privacy option is free for every domain registration and domain transfer. Since your information is not available, it prevents marketing firms, spammers, and online fraudsters from reaching your inbox. Here is a comparison between having domain privacy protection and not having it:

Note: Due to some regulations, this Domain Privacy cannot be used in some domains such as .uk,.us, .paris, .sg, and others. Make sure to check the complete list of domain names from their website to see if your domain is eligible. PremiumDNS Namecheap also offers a PremiumDNS plan that starts at $4.88/yr and renews at $9.98. It is an advanced DNS for websites that allows access to the fastest DNS servers that get 100% uptime. As such, your website will be online 100% of the time. It comes with DNS Security Extensions to prevent attacks that could affect your website's performance. You can use your PremiumDNS to protect your account even if you are using a different hosting provider. Unlike the basic DNS service, PremiumDNS offers faster performance, maximum site availability, and better security. Free SSL Certificate An SSL certificate verifies the security level of the website. 

There are different types of SSL certifications issued to websites depending on the level of protection and security features. Having an SSL certificate on your site assures users that the information they shared with you is safe and secured, thus increasing the trust between visitors and your site.

![screenshot of namecheap free SSL certificates tab](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/LOowqDV5g5izX8V-DEPsSR839Z1n33LjMBDHy0cc573SKzc5UgO0EvzpU_JMq2PdvWC2jdkuSScO329hNrxabJbYNTR9EKP3qN-8EIJcgIdKUg4cKp-O0FJCgiZ6jasZgAVoKRUn9hl8gsGWD_j2lCE)

Buying an SSL certificate from Namecheap is easy. You can find more information about each certificate before you decide if it is what you need for your site. After purchasing it, you'll need to activate, install, and then manage it in your account dashboard. These certificates come with a site seal that can be added to your site as proof of the certification issued. This is what most experienced web users are looking for in a site.

When buying an SSL certificate from Namecheap, they also offer customer service from their support team. Most of the SSL certificate offers use 128- and 256-bit encryption; the community standard for data protection. Namecheap guarantees that when you buy certificates from them and their partner - Comodo CA - they are safe, secured, and affordable.

Two-Factor Authentication This security feature offers an additional layer of protection for your account for free. You can choose from three different 2FA methods: using a specialized USB or NFC device that contains your encryptions, using another device that regularly changes passwords, or using a mobile phone to secure your account.
