Webinars can be one of the most powerful parts of your digital marketing strategy and can make or break your business and its profit - and are used by some of the most successful online marketers.

Just like webinars can help or hinder, the software you use to run your webinars is very important too. 

One of the most popular webinar platforms out there is **[WebinarJam](https://serp.ly/webinarjam/)**. 

50,000+ businesses use WebinarJam and we, at SEPR Co, believe it is one of the [best webinar softwares](https://devinschumacher.com/webinar-software/) available. 

In this WebinarJam review, we take a look at what you get when you sign up with WebinarJam., including things like their interaction options with viewers and how to schedule your 1st webinar and your 100th webinar. 

We’ll also talk about other pros and some cons of choosing WebinarJam and the pricing option that works best for you. No matter what you’re looking for in software, you’ll be able to make an informed decision by the end of this post. 

## What is WebinarJam?

![](/images/webinar-jam-review-image-1024x520.png)

**WebinarJam<** is a web-based platform where you can create live webinars. They have been working for seven years on creating one of the most powerful webinar platforms for live webinars. 

On a live webinar, you can engage with customers and viewers of the webinar, answer comments and questions in chat, and more. 

There are many other things you can do with their platform like creating webinar registration pages, send invites to potential attendees, schedule events, and check out analytics. 

Now, you’ll notice us using the word live webinars throughout this article and that’s because WebinarJam only offers the ability to do live webinars. You can’t run automated webinars with this software. 

An automated webinar is a webinar that runs when no host is at the screen during the presentation. 

Two pieces of good news with that though…

The first piece of good news is that WebinarJam works alongside its sister product EverWebinar. 

If you’re looking to have live and automated webinars, you can operate your live webinars with WebinarJam and then integrate with EverWebinar to create automated webinars that work for you 24/7. 

The second piece of good news is that you’d rather have software do one thing really great than a company splitting time between two things. 

WebinarJam is one of the best at live webinars and if they tried to put too many eggs in too many baskets, you’d lose quality in most of those baskets. 

Now, let’s take a look at some of the things you can do with WebinarJam. 

## Reach Thousands of Potential Customers

Once you sign up with WebinarJam, you’ll download their plugin and be a few clicks away from reaching your audience. Depending on your package you can reach up to 5000 people in one presentation. 

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/RO_erUmdc3WhMJ3BJExv_zW9tn0U793QOFZ-BEhY1nsnI30mURFWL1oUfEbPRJA3ijq0M3-Upi4Tf3Z_oo3Bb93ZKXf0BLfh6gqvrUWueqWlzNw08oMw-h4s_M-MuI2pTupHZUZk)

WebinarJam allows you to have up to six hosts, meaning that you can have a collection of experts to give training on a product or bring on customers to give their experience with your company. 

Of course, you can also just have one solo host running the webinar. All the host needs is a stable internet connection and a computer. 

They also allow you to share your screen, broadcast your webcam, or go through a PowerPoint presentation or slideshow. The best part about this is that you can blend through each of these things and create a smooth transition in one webinar. 

It is fully compatible with a wide range of OS (Windows, Linux, Mac and works on all major web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge). 

## Attendee Interactions 

One of the main reasons webinars work is because you are able to interact with your attendees in live time. Very few other marketing methods allow you to be as engaging as that. 

[WebinarJam](https://serp.ly/webinarjam/) has live chat and more. They have the option of viewers doing private comments, marking a comment, and highlighting it, and many moderation capabilities to control the webinar the way you’d like. 

There are two very important features they have that we want to highlight though. 

The first one is the option to have a question and answer period with chat. Let’s say you are running a webinar about blogging. Someone in your chat asks the question, “How do I start promoting my blog?” 

Your moderators can mark this comment by a viewer as a question and you will be able to see these questions highlighted and answer them as the host. 

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/mchqrnbHio_ejFhA1pwcIRhF5zD9O6S1tN30KLaFT4oO7WNp-NY4x_zY7zO15xm-mR5Kqk2RU-BzHRqIyL-HThUm32m5pKs5P4BD5DjRSiw0sAEvlm2TAuhFtIJeMnpbI5FL9rhQ)

This is powerful when selling on a webinar because most questions are either objections that you can solve or someone interested and wanting to find out just a little bit more before they buy. 

The other important feature that WebinarJam offers is the Poll feature. A host or moderator can start a poll just like you would see on many other social networks or chat rooms. 

This is crucial because it helps people engage with the webinar without actually speaking in chat. No matter how good of a host you have, there are just going to be people in your audience that don’t want to speak. Polls can help with that. 

Another good thing about polls is the social proof they can offer if you frame the polls correctly. Asking a question like, “Do you know someone that can use this service?” and getting lots of approvals in the polls will help make the skeptical watchers more likely to agree as well. 

## Automated Recordings

If you set it up in your settings, [WebinarJam](https://serp.ly/webinarjam/) will record your live broadcast for you automatically. But it doesn’t just record what’s on the screen. 

They record the chat, the polls, the questions, the screen, and anything else that could have happened during the webinar. 

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OrZh077nQnJdUEaARrsCnGYnwsTruI6EpFCMPddV7CJq3a3T5hcVqA3B-m8yGXFV5-EA8riBcCo7MZSXB7fRQQSVA00tF0g_ME4CPANrH3PcLXs2OOHhWmsoNCCcedLA4XVPnhvo)

So when the chat was commenting on the live webinar, the chat will roll in at the same time on the recording. This way, all the timing that you get down to a second for your best webinar chances can be replicated again. 

Now, we mentioned earlier that you can’t do automated webinars with just WebinarJam, but they do have the option to have replay rooms for viewers that signed up for your webinar and either didn’t make it or want to watch it again. 

So this automated recording will be available to anyone that signed up to watch the live webinar and you can schedule these to also play 24 hours or 72 hours after as well just for those extra attendees as you wish. 

## Scheduling Your Way

There are many different ways to schedule a webinar with WebinarJam. 

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/B06xgSlEcPLEY958F3sjWyPCNR2Fe3llcytJUovL4EIoS-M41juTVFgjXh33o_1v8uH4HZ02QvlE-Fk41PQqUrsibmywYc6U1J98u4JsXxlXv9dNuWfAxr3UHEKF6i3MlotPNmUe)

The first option you have is to start a session immediately. This is used if you need a live room right away and a link to have people join right upon clicking the link. 

You can schedule one session which would probably be the most common way to use WebinarJam. This allows you to set a time for everyone to show up on your email list or audience.

For example, you could set a webinar time for next Wednesday at 8 pm. Then you would know when to be there as the host and have moderators ready and your audience would know when to expect the webinar and also get reminders at certain points up until the webinar starts. 

WebinarJam also has an option to run a series of webinars. This is an option saved for those that have a product or service that takes more selling than just one webinar. These sessions can be scheduled over a certain amount of days, weeks, or months. 

Now, you might be thinking, “I want to have a live webinar every week. Why wouldn’t I just make a series of webinars.”

The reason why you wouldn’t want to do this is that if you create a series, the attendants that sign up for the series will get emailed for every webinar. So if you’re running the same webinar and webinar script each time, you’re just going to be emailing your list over and over about the same material. 

It’s like making your audience watch the same trailer over and over trying to get them to buy. You don’t want to alienate your list like that. 

The last option is only available if you choose a professional or enterprise plan and it’s called the Always-On Live room. This room will always be available for your hosts and team to be able to go live at any moment. 

Also, this room will always be the same URL that you designate it to be. For other webinars that aren’t in an Always-On Live room, each webinar will have a different link so your attendees will have to find that specific link. 

With this, they’ll just have to go to a URL that you have set up and can be easily memorized. 

## WebinarJam Pros & Top Features

![](/images/webinar-jam-features-1024x438.png)

Here are just some other benefits of choosing [WebinarJam](https://serp.ly/webinarjam/) as your webinar platform that we couldn’t fit in here. 

- They have training videos to teach you step-by-step how to start a webinar, set up landing pages, launch polls, and more. 
- Along with Q&A’s and polls, they have pop-up buttons, offers, countdowns and more to help sell your product or service. 
- Live representatives available 24 hours a day to help if needed. 
- Ability to send a webinar broadcasting link to your email list and anyone who clicks the link will be registered for your webinar. 
- You can analyze a wide range of metrics, including total visitors, registrations, viewers at any time, replays watched, clicks, and much more.
- Landing page templates that you can customize for your webinars. 
- Ability to bring any viewer onto the screen to ask questions or give their experience with the product or service. 
- WebinarJam supports the ability to have paid webinars. If needed, they have payment gateways and password protected webinar rooms. 
- Email and SMS notifications that ensure your viewers get to the webinar on time. 
- Allows for up to 5,000 webinar attendees and 6 hosts simultaneously.

## WebinarJam Cons

Just like with every other webinar platform, there are going to be a few hiccups when it comes to software. Here are a few things we noticed when checking out WebinarJam. 

- Your viewers could experience a 10-30 second streaming delay. This means you could be asking a question and have to wait 30 seconds before the viewers can answer you. Most webinars and streaming in general have a delay of around five seconds at minimum. But 30 seconds can be a big nuisance. 
- Live webinars were found to have HD quality but the automatic recordings and replays seem to be less than HD video quality. 
- Although this does mean that WebinarJam is more focused on creating one of the best live webinar platforms on the market, the fact that you have to also use EverWebinar to host automated webinars can be expensive depending on the company. 

## WebinarJam Pricing

When you look at WebinarJam’s pricing page, you have three options to sign up. 

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/e3bxSqw1wzRCMRSmUJ39WcXZR6lAX1-osHaCyBCodExtuLqKmIHa-5heyFCvEEco6-RO6P8WSdlZ-Ec-_9rA7FfQIKmvhevrX8HX8drTN2-9DwIlAfyVyCcr4Z0tKuwMAvvoEgGV)

### Basic Plan

The first option is the Basic Plan. It costs $499/year and you are allowed to have up to 500 attendees in your webinar room. 

Every plan comes with unlimited webinars and the Basic Plan includes the ability to have up to two hosts and a 2-hour max on your webinars. 

### Value For Money: The Basic Plan

WebinarJam offers a competitive price point for those looking for a less expensive webinar tool. The WebinarJam Basic plan starts at $41.50 per month and includes up to 500 attendees per webinar--over 50% more than the industry standard in this category of pricing.

One unique feature is WebinarJam's ability to distribute written handouts during a webinar.

They provide video injection and automated email reminders in addition to the typical features of most webinar platforms like shared screen presentation, YouTube uploads, polls, surveys, mobile broadcasting through live streaming or recording for playback on-demand.

WebinarJam includes numerous features in their basic plan, which is a good value for the price.

### Professional Plan

The middle option is their Professional Plan which costs $699/year. This plan allows up to 2000 attendees and up to four hosts and a 3-hour max on your webinars. 

The Professional Plan also comes with two extra features: The Always-On live room and The Panic Button. 

The Always-On live room is your own company’s webinar room that is open 24/7 for a host to log in and host a webinar within minutes. You don’t need to change anything or prepare anything. 

The Panic Button is an escape plan just in case technical issues happen. Video could freeze, the chat could stop moving, the host can lose connection, and many other things can happen. 

This button is basically like the refresh button on your browser. It makes a new room and redirects the hosts and attendees to the new room and will be available within seconds. 

The last plan WebinarJam offers is their Enterprise Plan. This is the plan created for much larger businesses. It is $999/year and allows 5000 attendees, up to six different hosts, and 4 hours max duration for your webinars. 

You also get the Always-On live room and The Panic Button but this option also comes with The Control Center as well. The Control Center is a backend room where your moderators can moderate chat, operate room features, and manage attendees. 

If you host very large webinars, you can’t possibly keep up with running the webinar and also moderating every viewer in your chat. The Control Center allows your moderators to take care of all of the moderation so your hosts can focus on running the webinar successfully. 

WebinarJam does offer a $1 trial for 14 days.  You can select the Basic, Professional, or Enterprise plan and get the $1 trial to test it out. 

## WebinarJam Customer Support

WebinarJam's customer support is really second to none.
