## HOSTEK Walkthrough

## Overview

[Hostek](https://serp.ly/hostek/), a US-based web hosting firm, was founded in 1998 and specializes in Linux and Windows hosting solutions. Shared hosting and WordPress and VPS hosting are just a few of the options that are available here. Hostek has servers in the United States and the United Kingdom. All pricing is presented in U.S. dollars on the agency's website, which is fully in English.

### Pros

- SSD storage

- Supports both Linux and Windows

- Guaranteed 99.999% Uptime 

- 30-day money-back guarantee

### Cons

- Slow customer support

- Expensive

Hostek is now fully operational in the UK, with a UK-based data center, and strives to offer solutions for organizations of all sizes. There are shared web hosting solutions available from Hostek, however, the company is mostly focused on commercial web hosting.

## Virtual Private Server

A wide range of VPS hosting options are available from Hostek. Pre-configured and custom-built servers are all included. Hostek's web hosting may appear to be a little on the pricey side at first glance, but it's actually rather affordable. Each strategy has hidden power and performance that must be remembered. 

There are a plethora of freebies offered in the whole of their plans. Free migrations and 99.999 percent uptime are included with every VPS hosting plan, in addition to Avast Anti-Virus and the Hostek Control Panel. Computer viruses, trojans, and other malicious malware will be prevented from infecting your server. 

This is included in all VPS plans at no additional cost. ESET Anti-Virus is a premium Anti-Virus alternative for those who desire it.  It is Hostek's proprietary control panel that is used for its hosting services. The cPanel-like control interface is simple to use, straightforward, and functions just as well.

Transferring your website from another web server to Hostek is free of charge. You don't have to worry about a thing while working with Hostek to move your website, data, or other things. Web hosting providers must offer an uptime guarantee to customers (to me anyway). 

The uptime guarantee from Hostek is comforting and demonstrates the level of professionalism displayed by this web host.

## Monitoring the Server Load

[Hostek's](https://serp.ly/hostek) web hosting isn't only limited to web hosting; it also includes a variety of other services. It's easy to forget about the management since they provide such an all-around service that you don't have to. 

Your web server's workload is constantly monitored and distributed across many servers via a load balancer. As a result, the stress on one server is lessened. There is always going to be a limit to the amount of Random Access Memory or Central Processing Unit your server has, thus a load balancer is necessary. 

You may get a customized price from Hostek by contacting them. Another thing I enjoy about Hostek is that they don't charge a flat fee for any additional services they provide. They recognize that every consumer is unique, and they strive to meet their demands.

## Host a Website

There are some services that Hostek claims will be available to everyone, regardless of whatever web hosting package they pick. IaaS and Data Centers both come to mind. There are other data facilities across the world to choose from including St. Louis (MO), Ashburn (VA), and the United Kingdom. 

Having a large number of data centers from which to pick is advantageous since you may base your server location on most of your traffic's origin. This will improve the user's overall experience! IaaS comprises a dedicated server engineer team, load balancer, and a private VLAN. A business-friendly web hosting service will have all of these options available.

## A Safer Way to Connect to the Internet

For remote server management, a virtual private network (VPN) is an excellent choice. This function can help any business, no matter how big or small it is. You'll be able to safely access your server from anywhere, even on your mobile device. 

A VLAN might be a better choice if you have numerous servers. You don't have to use public networks to connect to your server, which reduces the chance of security breaches. Fast connections, reduced latency, and higher throughput are all features that will be available to you.

## In-House Servers

Hostek's dedicated hosting services include a wide range of alternatives, such as:

- ColdFusion servers

- Lucee servers

- Linux servers with cPanel

- Windows-based servers

- cPanel-free Linux servers

Dedicated servers come with fully-managed servers and round-the-clock customer service. In this way, Hostek's customers are able to concentrate on the most important aspects of their business and website. 

Hostek's skilled team will handle all of your web hosting concerns, including performance, difficulties, and more.

## Features

Personal and Business shared hosting options are available from Hostek. In addition, both options offer unlimited storage space and monthly bandwidth.

- Guaranteed 99.999% uptime  

- SSD storage

- Automatic daily backups

- cPanel

- An installation for Softaculous

- Antivirus/Anti-spam

- CloudLinux OS

Hostek's Business plan only offers free Let's Encrypt SSL certificates, unlike other hosting services I've encountered. Both options, on the other hand, provide a complimentary SSL. As an alternative, RapidSSL and GeoTrust Premium SSL certificates can be purchased for an additional fee. 

On the Hostek shared hosting servers the CloudLinux OS is used to isolate every account on the system and secure it from unauthorized cyber threats. In addition, this functionality guarantees that server resources are distributed evenly across all accounts. 

Both plans include cPanel, a web hosting control panel renowned for its user-friendliness and comprehensive set of features. cPanel allows you to effortlessly manage all parts of your webpage, including your File Transfer Protocol accounts, directories, website files, domains, and website backups. 

Even though Hostek provides a wide selection of Linux and Windows hosting options, this does not justify the company's expensive rates. Another drawback for this company is the poor response time.

### Costs and Customer Service

Hostek's pricing is a little more expensive than those of the competition. All plans are offered on a month-to-month or year-to-year basis. You'll save money if you sign up for a year-long contract, though. However, Hostek is known for its frequent promotions. In addition to PayPal, this firm takes credit and debit card payments from all major banks. 

A 1-month money-back guarantee is included in all plans; you may receive a refund for wasted time even after the 30 days. If you're looking for help, Hostek provides an extensive knowledge library that contains articles, tutorials, and FAQs. 

Customer service is available by live discussion, contact, email, or a service ticket if you can't find what you're searching for there. To save time, I opted for the live chat option—or at least that's what I thought. 

On the header of the chat window, it says that they would respond to your queries within an hour, yet I received a response within more than 4 hours. Because of this hiccup, I was left with the sense that I couldn't rely on the customer service staff in an urgent situation. 

Hostek provides round-the-clock service so that you can be confident that you can get in touch with them at any time. Their Frequently Asked Questions, level of knowledge, ticket system, phone number, and live chat are all available. 

Having a place to talk to other Hostek users about problems and concerns is a huge plus for me. One instance of getting able to effectively obtain information when you need it is found in this situation as well. 

It's obvious that the people at Hostek take their jobs seriously since their customer service representatives were always kind and helpful. In the event of an issue, you can count on them to resolve it swiftly and effectively.

## Customer Feedbacks

“I have been onto support to someone named William, absolutely terrible, it been over 2hrs since he bothered to answer my last question, I can see he has seen the messages but just ignore them. AVOID this company, there are far better and cheaper ones out there…” -Paul Harvey

“Hostek are THE ColdFusion hosting provider to go with if you want an efficient, professional and friendly service.  They follow up on every support request very quickly and can sort out both mundane and complex issues with ease. With UK and US technical teams, it allows you to schedule maintenance and updating tasks at suitable times.  My advice, let [Hostek](https://serp.ly/hostek) take care of your servers!” -Clive Morris

## Conclusion

In my opinion, Hostek's commitment to its consumers was evident throughout my dealings with the company. From the beginning, I had the feeling that they provided a competent service for enterprises of all sizes, from sole proprietors to multinational conglomerates. 

All the way up to a fully-fledged dedicated server, they have it all. If you don't want your server to be managed, that's OK. Everything in their servers are pre-installed with cutting-edge security technologies that keep you safe from outside threats. 

Despite the fact that Hostek provides a wide selection of Linux and Windows hosting options, this does not justify the company's expensive rates. Another drawback of this provider is their poor response time. 

[Hostek](https://serp.ly/hostek) is an excellent choice if you need a reliable and effective web host for your business. You won't get a better commercial web host anywhere else, in my opinion!
