Because Hivelocity specializes in Dedicated Server Hosting and Colocation Services, we'll test one of those in this review.

We opted for their Dedicated Server plan, which is equipped with Instant Bare Metal Servers. With the cheapest web hosting package, you get four cores, 16GB of memory, 480GB of SSD storage, 20TB of transfers, and a port of 1Gbps, priced at $119.00 per month.

Once you have browsed and decided which the hosting plan you're going to choose, click Instant Deploy.

Doing this will take you to a different page with numerous tabs to customize your subscription.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/prDRpI2ZA49RAELwxvYOcBcS-HxRU3NgUP6OZsfuiE3aMg4jraah3OT52Rn81xHy_xS6rbHwr7lpLDYi8Mo4qu964QPd6BWg-3NjNxeiq28a71DaQDFYWU1Mc9uSBoR6LfL27iQfW9r4oqQJlTYA7A0)

The Hardware tab is the first thing you'll see once you get redirected to this page. Here, you can pick your data center location. Below this tab is where you can view the Processor, Hard Drive, and Memory that comes with your plan.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/PkQQuMiBxmvLf6qRPM2h57mJlXVN0qVmUAZb7el-rO_2w8DsDhGk5V_aD75UG4T2iNHNyQtdXhl2OhFnnPJmucfpytlpQQq4zrwzCh3vFgUouRdZGDxibbAvRSQWZYPZF-pKIFXiNC8SwrfdDCsFK9E)

Next would be the Software section. Here, you have options to change your Operating System, Control Panel, Managed Services, Lite Speed, and WHMCS.

The Network tab is where the allocated bandwidth, load balancing, and DDoS for your account are.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/jBXaWEKW1DU1ivc5KGoOZ6PmTvTGcEOal87aHtdbAF_sw7GavlgUHnh9dfaH2DQTT2yxvF7Ue-4PthaUI5Jx0KSlOtO3NK5rI5SmH89UITGDsjZWc332OPf4wQsq7ePczSHqFGAvRt7YCikYNpX2zkg)

The Addons tab, as the name suggests, is where you may purchase additional backups and restorations, as well as data migration for your website.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_ri5u-Zku9PqxftkQjMxWI4WA0tgM2YB7VA8vTOkiUAaqlPXGWjRd7awdTQ4J1pWkUqckcCB9LKLFKKJbFXwwXlcD0tzgGqsnfGGfbmXhMqSSJQn5naVELLmrSB8Sd_MNNq0kGvwg2cvKwVMJDzvXLc)

The User Data tab is where you execute your script/package tasks or trigger more advanced configuration processes after the server is ready.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/BByhoV0fJO4P9Ox_9MiVECVUP7HYwhYnFiBekFn7w7ArgEq5u2V8TRDHeKdlwIBBuDqjpyucs_8FdppjeQGWisOmpEkpBU02Gf5w91EfKr6Uo6IBAzkRlYaz_tSAlo9HvasPMXc_xxOF91wCvSdEIxQ)

## Using and Managing Your Website on Hivelocity

To log in to your account, click the Login to MyVelocity button on the upper right corner of the homepage.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/kgczmt5leycx9Xsewv8P8XDn3wKgxEmxdr1j3dRSzut729Y3P3YzNz5gNKz6xF7c9PnJo_f49goZK2PGCZo9yXRmnzxSJKdZ_HzHnBGfx8ljrYaoqUiPRA69xi4vCDg6HfSSyfCIALCFkQJjTXMNn3Q)

Here, you need to enter the login credentials you registered upon signing up.

Once you have logged in successfully, you can now manage your account using the 

MyVelocity Control Panel.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/O4IgQ0wgLTM2K_xWSjkH03zIrxbK3bdemDcpdfctVwq3giMngti7s3iozsYcX-3Sp1QfPp09tftnr8iaRZmxfyZWfqxmkbgF2QMM9PDgOF0gyY-KbsSmsIDSkRkX0nSFDn82kUMG5JnnjxhpHM2Md8U)

Here, you have quick access to all vital sections of your account. You can manage servers and services, host and manage DNS, submit and manage tickets, reboot controls, monitor bandwidth, and access live order tracking.

## Hivelocity Control Panel

[Hivelocity](https://serp.ly/hivelocity) gives you the option of selecting the operating system (OS) and control panels for the servers you purchase. Panel alternatives include the well-known cPanel, DirectAdmin, and Plesk Panel, but they also have other possibilities: H-Sphere, Virtuozzo, SolusVM, ProxMox, and others are examples.

Moreover, Hivelocity offers server management systems such as cPanel and Plesk for an additional price; you may get them for free; however, the features are only limited. So if you want to maximize such panels, it is better to purchase them.

cPanel

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/veV44alzOF8iDy55tOkkqHSlMKri-DvImXxTGruIgrcSLoohgjrFek8mzKXpXXQwimRr7CUepd6bW_by_p3koyOPiOGpj6dNL48SH6ix3FhvtOa2dPbOE_zo78mxz8GRPUAqW5N_XKZ5tSIdXYwsMrc)

For a good reason, cPanel is the most popular control panel in the hosting industry. It is simple to use. You can use the control panel to manage your files, databases, email accounts, and other website hosting-related tasks.

Consider cPanel to be the command center for your web hosting platform, as this is where you will go to do a variety of operations.

### Email

One advantage of hosting your website with a cPanel-enabled web host is the possibility to create custom email accounts for your domain.

Several tools are available, such as those for creating new emails, configuring forwarders and autoresponders, dealing with spam, and much more.

### Domains

Under the Domains area of cPanel, you may add new domains to your account, set up parked domains, establish subdomains, set up redirects, and much more.

You must have a domain registered and linked to your server before you can set up cPanel. As a result, uploading it directly to cPanel would have no effect.

### File Management

Through the files area of cPanel, you may backup your cPanel account, view and modify files stored in your account, evaluate your disk utilization, and even create and manage FTP accounts.

#### File Manager

The File Manager, as the name implies, is where you can manage your files. This area allows you to move, edit, upload, update, delete, and restore documents.

#### Backup

Using the Backup tool, you may keep and save your files, databases, forwarders, and filters to a backup file.

#### Disk Usage

The overall disk space used by your account includes all data, including website files, MySQL databases, and email messages. You'll see an overview of your disk space use when you log into cPanel.

#### FTP

FTP can be used to grant or prohibit access to your hosting account. FTP can be used to upload files to your website. You can define which directories the new user will be able to access and how much space they will occupy.

### Databases

All new websites can not function without a database, which works quietly behind the curtains to manage the website's content.

Simply said, the database contains all of your website's information, including all pages, posts, and personal information.

### Metrics

Keeping track of various website statistics is critical to your overall performance in business and marketing. You may review key statistics, track faults, and monitor your bandwidth usage in the Metrics section.

Using this tab, you could determine where your website's visitors are coming from, how many people are accessing your site, and which portions of your website are being visited the most frequently.

### Security

Perhaps one of the significant considerations you can do is keep your website secure. Using the utilities in this category, you may restrict SSH access, ban IP addresses, and prevent your images from being hot-linked. This is also where you can manage your website's security certifications.

### Software

Exploring the software area can help you improve the functionality of your website. Important tools are provided here to assist you with the setting of software on your website.

### Advanced

Operations in this section are not commonly practiced but are nevertheless suitable for advancement.

### Preferences

Numerous significant components of the cPanel interface can be customized using the Preferences section.

## Hivelocity Customer Support

Hivelocity's main selling point is that they are large enough to satisfy all of your server needs while remaining small enough that every customer is important.

They market their employees' knowledge with their hardware and software. Their onsite engineers are available 24/7 to troubleshoot OS, network, hardware, and firewall issues.

The most frequent way to contact the support team is through the MyVelocity management panel, but you may also reach out to them by Facebook, Twitter, Google+, or phone.

The tech support staff is courteous and available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. You can contact them by calling their toll-free number, sending an email, or submitting support tickets, which takes 10-15 minutes to respond to.

Upon reading Hivelocity hosting reviews on HostAdvice and TrustPilot, most users are satisfied and happy with the service they provide.

If you prefer not to contact Hivelocity's support team, they also have a knowledge base for you to read.

## Buyer’s Guide For Hivelocity

## Plans and Pricing

Dedicated Servers - Plans start at $119.00/month.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xK3CIzFT8gC40LTFsTKnaIkfUIJ8TwJzJjg437PKUtGOh1Naz2ke_VClNk0OhP0W_I267UaWeSUylvoqUyHADIanWP4OievCwRG3kcamqoy37y9xEpdB6ZgJBqhk2xpQGpUEN9KRC0tcZnfUPwIgytA)

[Hivelocity](https://serp.ly/hivelocity) provides a variety of pre-built servers for dedicated hosting, which they refer to as "instant provisioning." Instant server deployment is only available for dedicated server plans and does not apply to VPS, colocation, or hybrid services.

Unlike shared hosting or virtual private servers, which require users to share resources with other domains on a single server, dedicated server hosting provides customers with complete control over their server's resource consumption and hardware specs. 

You may preserve the highest levels of security and control over your system's features, including its operating system, control panel, internal software, and more, by running your own private instant server.

All servers have IPMI access, are connected to a private network and are built on rack-mount chassis from Dell and SuperMicro.

Colocation Services - You need to contact Hivelocity's experts to get a quotation.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/3erT8SOW0NgdtTE5LZUo7oI9lMf1EtLme90NGMuR3ix5NfekoqdlquxBdBbrQWOkG7H0AgCEPYU1hsagBNOBKpkapW-_rh4zTK8YzyGXs7ge0PdjHXLfGvTp7Fa_O8mIzZWdfIsZOh82vyOjZrSQoHI)

Colocation Services is a specialized solution in which you pay to store and manage the infrastructure surrounding your own physical server.

Colo clients can cross-connect with Hivelocity's instant or custom servers at any time to create a hybrid network that combines your own servers with their leased possibilities.

If your hardware fails, Hivelocity's onsite team may obtain replacements or upgrades for RAM, CPU, SSD (and other drives), motherboards, or power supplies using bulk savings from manufacturers such as Dell, SuperMicro, and Kingston.

Bare Metal - You need to contact Hivelocity's experts to get a quotation.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/G0Ni7mw1_VLVE1Jj5P1v_i-QzspMuuZrULWZGxW3PprxeIlEuW_pBZpWTwKuxMk20LUWk7ZvgANZFTURUnQts3GqJNnzcOBpSOB_DqMCmAKKVWfdCdSNr2biPjsAd9l5b6E3Tl4qgs6FdXnFrjdeyqM)

This is an utterly redundant system that can be installed in any major data center anywhere in the world in 90 days.

This hosting package is appropriate for industrial facilities that need process control systems close to the factory floor, as well as telecommunications providers wishing to deliver compute and storage to cell towers or EDGE POP sites for caching or processing.

Content Delivery Network - Prices are based on the location of your data centers.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oz26jangaCT6QBFuKDiLOYIBpCyhnLyv_rPelrH8cXfB9TJMUIdZ3MtE0srjLk3z2krREu7GPTDnKDXTycX4h8yI3qCD8646gt1FFb3kq7sGRGLA_uYYwWVYyuXutAYU9XDkZSsD2NqCF7Pt4CYj6JE)

Hivelocity's CDN is quite ordinary. You pay for outgoing data, although the cost varies depending on your location. 

If you have a lot of outgoing overseas data, transmitting to the United States is more costly per gigabyte. You can instantly delete or block material based on its geographic location.

Private Cloud - You need to contact Hivelocity's experts to get a quote.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/JaKHHipIadQRlNjKMHAAV2PmiWbQ0LNtyb2E-59Bnx1hP302g-GXiZ4CDPpnLLehLglJmBPvXawdlOHpHVscVljNNG6kB-mYZVciOB3bG5GIHOprcUxHlT4oO70BIhQ9KhDU6f1cAAt6cyg5yKc277c)

A private cloud is a one-tenant system with dedicated hardware. There are no pre-defined plans for this option; the environment is entirely yours so Hivelocity can tailor the cloud to your exact specifications. You can then further create your cloud by configuring your virtual environments with Proxmox or something similar.

The most important advantage of a Private Cloud is the assurance of anticipated and controlled costs, allowing you to plan and budget appropriately.

Custom Solutions - You need to contact Hivelocity's experts to get a quote.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/3eapBGBwzk72uxZrmOz_DvW1YiHkhKWAHhA0OYVVRJRz-5oA_UQlURQLwbNvDk0Pyc4teK90dvF1gGJCnLhN6CqJ1bTOJOANe2PXyD4N9vkX-0-xT9zXiOoT1FP7pUCO2FlmIz9aq9BDyUS1zGQOpMM)

As the name implies, Custom Solutions is where Hivelocity caters to your specific hardware configurations, which is why you need to talk to their experts so they can build private clouds, server clusters, or virtual environments based on your data needs.

Outlet Servers - Plans start at $70.00/month.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ovhbGcIwU6cvbaaaE-kDXC82uhKigZJHQ0h4K0kPKZQaE1HBeIPU8WCpKgGCZ-d5wBu8MVAHKwcKFdSP8tFazFPaZVSb2E71jGxaj6vHgM6uxb4pf5DCW_i0dshlh116sDaVhNMjYUCo7jvLP4_2xOw)

If your department's budget is limited, consider Hivelocity's outlet servers. A handful of these less expensive servers are even available for immediate deployment in as little as seven minutes.

The outlet servers feature older-generation processors, but there is no difference in security, network, or support than what they offer on their more current servers.

## Server Speed and Uptime

Hivelocity guarantees uptime 99.99 percent of the time, which implies that all users are eligible for a 5% credit upon demand if they encounter something less than what was promised. Scheduled maintenance, on the other hand, is not included. 

Keeping this in mind, TechRadar tracked the uptime of Hivelocity's main website for a month and was pleasantly surprised to discover a report reflecting a flawless 100 percent uptime.

When it comes to speed, TechRadar tested Hivelocity's main website. After several tests from various server locations, they were met with much the same level of bad results in terms of speed; however, the site's structure got impressive. The site took 4.6 seconds to load fully, faster than the average response time of 8.1 seconds.

## Security and Backups

For IT administrators looking for a hosting option, protecting your company's data is the cost of entry. Hivelocity employs patented technology to ensure overall system security, preventing 95% of threats entering the Hivelocity data ecosystem.

For an additional cost, your company can strengthen its defenses against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) assaults by routing traffic through a smart wall appliance.

SSL Certificates

Backups

It is generally a good idea to back up your website if something goes wrong and ruins it. There are numerous methods for backing up your website, including the cPanel backup feature. However, if you want more control over your backup, you should utilize a command-line application.

If your company's information is breached in any way, be mindful that Hivelocity considers data backup to be an "add-on" to their hosting services.

The cost of Rapid Restore is determined by the amount of data you wish to safely backup.
