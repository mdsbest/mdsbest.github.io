# [ManyChat](https://serp.ly/manychat): The Worldâ€™s Best Review of This Awesome Chatbot & List Growth Tool

One of the most well-known and widely used chatbot software platforms that are compatible with Facebook Messenger is called ManyChat. It is an incredible platform that enables you to construct your chatbot in just a few minutes, and a substantial number of individuals from all over the world utilize it.

## Interface for Users

The interface of ManyChat's dashboard is very straightforward, consisting of a menu on the left side containing a variety of options and the content of each area on the right side. It is a very simple dashboard that can be grasped in a short amount of time:

![Untitled](/images/Untitled-9.png)

When it comes to the process of constructing a chatbot, the interface that ManyChat provides is one of the nicest that I have ever seen in a chatbot platform. This is due to the fact that ManyChat offers two distinct kinds of user interfaces, which are referred to respectively as The Basic Builder and The Flow Builder.

## The Fundamental Builder

When you use the Basic Builder, the content of your chatbot will be more ordered, and all of the messages that belong to a certain flow will be delivered in the correct sequence. This interface may be simple, as its name suggests, but it ensures that you will be able to maintain order within your chatbot.

## The Flow Builder

You also have the option of using something called the Flow Builder, which provides a graphical interface for editing your chatbot. The Flow builder is a visual interface that allows you to connect messages and actions with one another through the use of a drag-and-drop method.

The content of your chatbot may be viewed in a more organized fashion using this type of builder, which gives you an overview.

When you have a lot of content in your chatbot, one of the typical drawbacks of having this kind of interface is that it can quickly become extremely cluttered.

However, if you use ManyChat, you will always have the option to switch to the Basic Builder, which will allow you to maintain everything in its place.

## Component of a Chatbot

ManyChat gives you access to an almost exhaustive inventory of chatbot components that you may use to develop your own chatbot.

The main drawback is that they do not have any lists, but this is not a deal breaker in any way because you can always use a Gallery instead. They are performing significantly better than a number of different chatbot software here.

## Users

The process of assigning user-specific custom fields and tags is made exceptionally simple within ManyChat.

You need just provide questions to users, and their responses can either be saved in a user-defined field or tagged with a specific label. You'll be able to send broadcasts to specified user segments if you make use of those custom fields and tags.

In addition, users have the ability to communicate their location to a ManyChat chatbot. This may provide you with more information regarding the geographical location of your audience.

Under the "Audience" page of ManyChat, you will be able to see a list of everyone who uses your chatbot. This provides you with a comprehensive overview of everyone who has interacted with your chatbot in the following ways:

It is quite helpful because you are able to click on any individual user in this overview and obtain all of the information pertaining to that user:

![Untitled](/images/Untitled-13.png)

## Messages

Broadcasts, sequences, and the ability to subscribe to or unsubscribe from sequences are all features that may be found in Manychat.

The fact that the sequences in ManyChat are very well arranged is one of the aspects of the program that I appreciate the most.

You are able to see the entire sequence in one convenient overview, and you can also see which message is sent at which time, which is a very helpful tool.

![Untitled](/images/Untitled-14.png)

You can also make advantage of a feature in ManyChat known as "Conditions," which allows you to employ logic in order to direct users through a particular flow.

It is feasible to create a chatbot in any language using ManyChat; however, it is not possible to translate this chatbot into other languages in an easy manner (because you need to do this manually and copy all your complete chatbots).

## Artificial Intelligence(AI) & Natural Language Processing(NLP)

The AI and NLP capabilities of ManyChat are extremely user-friendly. Within ManyChat, you have the ability to organize particular keywords into groups and assign predetermined responses to each of those groups.

On the other hand, neither intents nor automatically generated synonyms are supported. The way it appears within ManyChat:

![Untitled](/images/Untitled-15.png)

They do, however, offer the choice of how the keyword is matched within the context of their keywords feature. This is a function that is not present in all chatbot software. It's possible to argue that:

- A message has the same meaning as a keyword.

- The keyword is included in the message.

- The complete term is included in a message.

- The keyword is the first part of a message.

- A message gets the two fingers up (a standard feature in Facebook Messenger)

Both ManyChat and DialogFlow lack an integration that is direct with one another. On the other hand, I worked out a guide that explains how you can link ManyChat to Dialogflow.

## Channels

It is possible to create a chatbot for your website, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, SMS, or email by using ManyChat.

This enables you to provide your users with an omnichannel experience when interacting with your chatbot. You could, for instance, send an email to a recipient based on their response to a question you sent to them over Facebook Messenger if they answered the question in a particular way.

Users in the United States and Canada are the only ones who can receive text messages that you send using SMS. You will need to make use of the Twilio integration that is available in the ManyChat App Store in order to send text messages to countries outside of the United States (additional costs apply).

Additionally, Telegram is now in a closed beta testing phase, which suggests that this channel will likely be included in ManyChat in the near future.

## Integrations

Integration with live chat is already incorporated into ManyChat. Wow, that's fantastic news because this is the single most crucial integration a chatbot platform should have. In addition to this, they provide integrations for:

- Zapier

- Make (formerly Integromat)

- Google Sheets

- ActiveCampaign

- MailChimp

- ConvertKit

- HubSpot

- Walletly

- Botsheets

- Janis

By the way, one of the aspects of ManyChat's live chat integration that I appreciate the most is that the company offers both an iOS app and an Android app, allowing you to answer customer inquiries even when you are not in front of your computer.

In addition, ManyChat has its very own app store, where third-party developers can publish their own integrations for the platform.

The App Store currently has 38 applications available for download, but I anticipate this number will steadily increase over the coming years:

## Marketing

It is possible to put a Facebook Messenger widget on your website, create a [landing page](https://devinschumacher.com/landing-page-optimization-tools//), connect to Facebook ads, use the One-Time Notification and the Recurring Notifications, automatically reply to Facebook comments, create buttons, and create custom URLs for your chatbot. All of these features are available to you through the Facebook Messenger platform.

In addition, ManyChat features an extremely sophisticated auto-reply to comments made on Facebook posts.

When you create a post on Facebook, other users will remark on it, and then you will automatically send a message to those users via Facebook Messenger. This is how the auto-reply to Facebook Comments feature works.

However, ManyChat takes things a step further. In addition to sending a message through Facebook Messenger, you also have the option to automatically like the comment and respond to it with your own comment:

## Pricing

Pricing is potentially the most crucial aspect. ManyChat offers a free plan that will never require payment of any kind. This package comes with a thousand contacts but does not include all of the capabilities that are offered by ManyChat (but still enough to make a good chatbot).

You can subscribe to the Pro plan if you want extra features, which costs only fifteen dollars per month, which is a fairly affordable price:

![Untitled](/images/Untitled-18.png)

The cost of the Pro plan increases proportionately with the number of users who subscribe to your chatbot. The cost of maintaining 1k subscribers is $25 per month while maintaining 5k subscribers costs $45 per month.

This package also includes a free trial of ManyChat's Pro features that you can use for a period of seven days at no additional cost. In addition to that, there is a money-back guarantee for a period of thirty days with no questions asked.

## Analytics

ManyChat's dashboard includes several fundamental analytics for users. The first thing that you will see when you access the dashboard is a comprehensive summary of all of your subscribers, including:

![Untitled](/images/Untitled-19.png)

In addition to that, they offer metrics tailored to each individual block in your chatbot. They provide the number of people the message is delivered to, the percentage of people who open the message, and the percentage of people who click on the message for each block.

![Untitled](/images/Untitled-20.png)

The same is true for sequential events. The following information is supplied for each sequence: the number of subscribers, the open rate, and the click rate:

![Untitled](/images/Untitled-21.png)

There are just two limitations to the analytics that can be found in ManyChat, and they are as follows:

- Analytics vary. There is no single dashboard with all pertinent analytics (Broadcasts, Sequences, etc.)

- Unmatched keywords have no overview. ManyChat dashboards don't show unanswered words. It prevents chatbot improvement.

This is one of the potential drawbacks of using ManyChat. Analytics is an essential component of any chatbot since, with their help, you will be able to make your chatbot better in no time.

Because the metrics provided by ManyChat are mostly geared toward flows and not toward providing responses to inquiries, it can be challenging to optimize the responses provided by your chatbot.

ManyChat released the ManyChat Pixel as an update in the year 2020. This is a snippet of code that you can insert into your website in order to monitor the number of conversions that are attributed to your chatbot.

This pixel will trace a conversion back to the specific flow whenever a user clicks on a link button within Messenger and then converts on your website. You can now determine which flows result in the highest conversion rates!

## eCommerce

**ManyChat has a direct integration with Shopify, which enables users to do the following:**

- To gather up lost shopping carts.

- Notify clients of order and transport status changes.

- Acquire comments and ratings following a purchase.

- Successfully inspire repeat buying.

However, the bot cannot be used to make a purchase from your Shopify store.

However, if you integrate your chatbot with payment processors like Stripe or PayPal, you may accept payments from customers and have them make purchases without ever leaving the chat.

The only real issue is that ManyChat isn't compatible with WooCommerce. But you can still link up with WooCommerce if you use an integration service like [Zapier](https://devinschumacher.com/review/zapier/) or Integromat.

## Templates & Cloning

A total of 19 pre-made chatbot templates are available for use with ManyChat. In this category, you'll find both free and premium templates.

ManyChat allows users to create and distribute chatbot starter kits. When developing a suite of similar chatbots, this is quite helpful (for example, [Lead generation](https://devinschumacher.com/what-is-lead-generation/)).

The speed of your chatbot can also be increased by duplicating its flows and its elements.

## Optimization

While ManyChat supports A/B testing, this feature is not included in the free tier. Therefore, if you want access to this function, you must subscribe to the "Pro" plan.

## Support

ManyChat's platform and the process of creating a chatbot are thoroughly documented in their numerous tutorials. Moreover, they have helpful documentation and responsive support staff.

I also appreciate that there is a sizable Facebook group (80.000 members) for ManyChat where you can get answers to your questions and find out more about the service.

## Final Verdict

My recommendation for creating a chatbot for Facebook Messenger is ManyChat. It offers a well-organized and adaptable user interface, a wide variety of chatbot components, a wide range of integrations, and ample room for the development of your own personal chatbot. You can't find a better chatbot for Facebook Messenger than this one.

**I can only think of two negatives:**

- It lacks WhatsApp, Twitter, Slack, Telegram, and Skype integrations. This may hinder omnichannel experiences. However, many users don't care. They also integrate email and SMS.

- Basic metrics make chatbot optimization difficult.

ManyChat is a really high-quality piece of software that you can use to construct your chatbot, and in light of recent developments, I believe that they will expand their platform even more.
