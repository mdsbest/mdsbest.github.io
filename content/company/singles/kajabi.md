In today’s fast-paced lifestyle, everything needs to be quick and easy, including education. Studies have shown that online education takes 40 to 60% less time to complete than traditional learning. 

Since the pandemic hit, people have become much more likely to invest money in e-learning, and online entrepreneurs should definitely capitalize on it.  

That is why many people have started to utilize Kajabi.

But it’s not just students who need instant solutions.

The fact is creating, distributing, selling, and managing your own online courses is not something you can learn to do overnight.

It can be tedious, time-consuming, and demand a whole set of skills and programs if you want to do it right. 

Finding the course platform, actually creating the course, doing some email marketing, making landing pages, offering a free trial, and much more.

Thankfully, there are many useful resources out there to give you a hand and achieve in days that would otherwise take months. 

That is why I took the time to write this **Kajabi Review**.

Today I want to introduce you to one of the best tools in the market nowadays, Kajabi.

## What Is Kajabi?

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/s3_D5GzJWkTtRJbCE2-vjMKe1ORx8irhE7DQ6oOidOp4mDwFDf8mYOM35gyYEAcxkkTiTGBzfX28GhPBgBeIem8eY1e-Sw-Mvvoe8T41Af94WCf15HqY4b7sJmIMho_mR-LZE2Pa)

[Kajabi](https://serp.ly/kajabi/) stands out from the crowd as an all-in-one platform that promises to offer you everything you need to start your own online course business. 

In a nutshell, it allows you to create a professional website to develop, market, and sell your own online courses and other digital products. You can customize every single aspect of your business without ever having to resort to any other software.

It provides a site builder with free hosting and SSL, a library of themes for you to find the one that matches your style, and blog accessibility. You can upload all kinds of materials from text and PDFs to videos and even quizzes.

It was created in 2010 and today has over 25,000 individual course creators, including a few big names in the e-learning industry, like Brendan Burchard and Amy Porterfield. 

In today’s figures, 25,000 users might not sound impressive. But Kajabi says they collectively made over one billion dollars in profit. 

Just for fun, this is what one billion looks like compared to 50K and one million.

Didn’t see that one coming, huh?

That’s right. This is how much money a single platform can make. 

## Kajabi Review

### What Makes Kajabi Unique?

I know this sounds a lot like other similar platforms, so what makes Kajabi different? 

The beauty of it is that it is a one-stop-shop that does everything for you. It is like the swiss army knife of online course platforms. You don’t need to invest in any additional tools at all! 

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Bobs-Burgers.webp)

 It is not just a course marketplace that barely allows you to manage the content of your course. Kajabi gives you full control of your business, including payments, marketing, appearance, and functionalities from a single dashboard. 

This platform gives you access to several marketing features, allowing you to [create email lists](https://devinschumacher.com/affiliate-marketing-for-dummies/), and gain insight into how your audience is doing. 

## Kajabi Top Features

### Site Builder

This is perhaps Kajabi’s strongest feature and also the most intuitive. It allows you to fully customize your website in a drag-and-drop interface. 

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JGWcAunQSFNaBfZqDjk5F4zy8TOpNr0myboMFnz6GrgzeP1PbAofY4T-xTY9L10hrg4s5v0PsD-VEJmjY9g89SBIq_bcibySzYOHZp8EHBt499uCDyKR4KJ1Vt0MWXaAIlWd4XfD)

The process is pretty straightforward and there are plenty of themes and styles for you to choose from. It is even possible to assign different themes to different sections of your site. 

Although it is not necessary, you can also access the code to make some specific HTML and CSS edits. 

All of Kajabi’s plans give you access to a custom domain name, although you might have to upgrade your subscription to remove the “Kajabi” from the URL. 

### Course Creation

Creating new courses from scratch on Kajabi is relatively easy as well. You can add downloadable files like PDFs, images, text, audio, and video. It is also possible to bulk upload all of your content straight from a storage service like Drive or Dropbox. 

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/1tupo8ykdjcsYx89X1ptCDTqGGiLAI0yreoULlLpdbi5jGpwRGTEB4niH8oJJLRz4PczxRuOePrrxmoVFy2rWD3X-Xb2-kolVh_13ZqoOLHkbV_y7vgJVb8DUqQeOXepimpQRkB0)

Even though Kajabi supports a wide range of content formats, it is mostly focused on videos hosted through Wistia. A big disadvantage here is that you’re not allowed to add more than one type of multimedia in a single lesson. 

All of your courses can be assigned categories and organized using different criteria. Your audience will be able to navigate your course library applying filters such as price, skill level, and length. 

### Sales Pipeline Builder

Kajabi is the perfect ally for those who have little to no marketing knowledge. Its sales pipeline builder allows you to create various types of marketing funnels. 

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/W7FpG6ab8Ihxtr7TTES8E1kUx75-y6WoGDahKgoNaeJwUce14k1Z0sqwPsHJcNcEz4JkgfSCtkesq7RID2Dnlo4DsZ8c_o5FcEAB5NZBULKIjbDjVz-PD4Kw1bQEX4Z7SYkLJKBy)

All you have to do is select a blueprint depending on what kind of funnel you need, or just build one from scratch, and Kajabi will take it from there. It will automatically create your landing pages and email campaigns without ever leaving the builder. 

No other tool offers such effective funnel-building capabilities. 

### Automation Tools

When it comes to automation, Kajabi did an amazing job bringing your email marketing to the next level. 

It allows you to create automated email campaigns based on users' actions. You can do things like add or remove users from a sequence as soon as they purchase a product, or send coupons to your new subscribers. 

A big con here is that you can’t assign specific dates to your email campaigns, but it is still a game-changer for beginners. 

### Kajabi University

Learning how to use a platform with so many different functionalities can be overwhelming. There’s too much to digest before getting started and it can’t be done without a little help. 

In case you’re new to this, Kajabi features an entire website full of tutorials, guides and resources to get you started completely for free. 

Their catalog is quite impressive and promises to take you from zero to expert in several different areas. 

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OxKh6o0RBu1yGPTL1SZfMz2XYcZ2R-kgwMTBBjw8bdw7JyTO78LGQuiB_rSPMN20FFXyAZJe5iSdMs3sScsP4BerDNj8cRQ9a1xMjPyDpTlHDb6ANlzkU73VAEeJKLThzOOQbN3t)

It pretty much answers all the questions that might arise while using the platform, but you can also ask them for help if you get stuck. 

### Customer Support

Kajabi is one of the few tools that offer live chat support 24/7 from the Growth pricing plan upwards. The Basic plan only gets to use this service during business hours. 

It also allows you to generate tickets and participate in live Q&A training sessions. 

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Cereal-Robot.webp)

Another thing worth mentioning is that you can talk to a real human instead of one of those annoying bots that never solved anything for anyone. 

Plus, their support team has awesome reviews. Kajabi users are generally very satisfied with it, and for this kind of platform, that’s saying a lot!

### Kajabi Mobile App

One of the first things software companies have to understand about their audience is how important it is for them to be able to use their product on the go. 

Kajabi did a great job developing a mobile solution that is user-friendly while remaining as functional as its desktop counterpart. 

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/COmivHRX8-n5M8guJ3SMEb9lG4XRYiPbT1Kxiogpl85bkPs-nh9TZlgTq96Iumtk7InPBdSvdYSR3vKz-LtyHPoRCemzgeSzEVZtSI495fkJje70lW2hJpfxaJz8FgpmqNN8D4Kn)

As a course creator, it will help you stay connected to your audience and improve your engagement significantly. 

This is especially useful when it comes to taking part in a community. Push notifications will let you know whenever there’s a new question, comment, or announcement. 

The app is completely synchronized with the desktop version. This means that just like when you resume your Netflix episode from different devices, Kajabi’s app lets you pick up where you left off. 

## Advantages of Kajabi

### Full Control Over Your Business

You can make your website look exactly how you pictured it. Themes, domain, and design are fully customizable.

It also allows you to establish your own marketing strategy, prices, payments, and format of your course material. 

### Community Feature

This allows you to keep track of your student engagement. You can enable students to leave comments and open discussions about relevant topics. 

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/pcSXjEGimw4pEtHdGiB1oKorHCl7Ifpm3nHGrqmzWHPH9H8TgyI5uciktcR-kE9WiLrz2KGFfirOUT7gb00rGHLqfj_u12bk35SaD5xBU9sq-vAGUHvqPxzJSzYPI2VosPQgPf3Q)

This function will also let your students see each other’s profiles and send personal messages. It works like a forum and can be a great alternative to Facebook groups. 

### Several Different Payment Options

Including different methods and plans, like monthly payments for the most expensive courses. 

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Money-Computer.webp)

### Tons of Built-in Features

This is exactly why so many course creators choose to switch to Kajabi. In order to successfully carry out an e-learning business, most creators pay several different subscription plans for the tools they’re gonna need.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/q-XRLwLUJCku-QtR1BtW5iFr2CIL9H07eVf-kjtjvseMpZ1xp-MXhba_B7B4qnpHJAomcAErBKLBm8I3da8-v-k_YYY1VWwWa99b0eVCf4xLsHNGh81LApx9cTXtSxJYU--E2jUU)

Even though Kajabi is more expensive than the average platform it is also way more convenient since you don’t need to pay for any third-party resources. 

### Unbeatable Suite of Marketing Tools

No more jumping from one platform to the other or learning how to use a marketing tool to improve your sales.

Kajabi’s built-in sales funnel software and marketing automation are designed to turn your site visitors into customers. 

### Great Video Streaming Capabilities 

Kajabi integrates with Wistia, one of the leading video hosting platforms, without you having to pay for a separate license.

This will ensure your videos will adapt to any bandwidth or screen without sacrificing quality. 

### Not Just For Courses

You can create and market pretty much any digital product.

From coaching programs to student communities, Kajabi provides all sorts of templates for the type of content you’re offering. You’ll have your whole business up and running in no time. 

## Disadvantages of Kajabi

### No Free Option

Unlike other similar tools, Kajabi doesn’t offer any kind of free plan, and it is actually pretty expensive. 

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Simples.webp)

But on the other hand, you wouldn’t have to pay for any additional tool. We’ll discuss later on whether the price is worth paying. 

### Not Very User-Friendly

Kajabi’s interface is far from intuitive. It definitely takes a while to get acquainted with all the functionalities and where to find them. 

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Buttons.webp)

This clearly has to do with how much you can do with it, though.

A tool that only serves a single purpose is always going to be easier to use than an all-in-one platform that promises to solve all of your problems. 

This can be solved with a solid help center and tutorials to help you figure out how things work. In this case, they came up with something called [Kajabi University](https://serp.ly/kajabi/), which contains everything you need to know to get started. 

That being said, this is still a tool that allows you to fully develop your own website without you having to get your hands on the code at all.

I’d say it’s only fair to spend a couple of hours understanding the process. It is still completely doable by anyone who lacks the technical knowledge. 

### No Multi-Tenancy Option

You can actually create multiple sites, but not under the same umbrella. So, for example, if you’re a company that works with several different clients who need their own branded section in the platform, this will be a significant limitation. 

### Poor Completion Certificates

While Kajabi does allow you to credit your students when they finish a course, the certificates are extremely basic and don’t include relevant details like the number of hours dedicated to learning.

Most course creators end up using a third-party tool for this. 

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/W_cCKMmlxoXkYk74TWCtoaxgsvWBFOnv-5z8sEt0ISU-0dbk4rNko3KuVb2z5-AUvSQ1kY-3tDh8eel6ucFNBQmt8zt2YBELBA-hrzJTw8m9Pje9cH1iSUYSdOYJ0qLi9ngNW6gH)

## How Much Does Kajabi Cost?

Like all of its competitors, Kajabi offers three different plans, the second being the most convenient. 

You might want to go for the Basic one if it is your first time launching this kind of digital product, but most users end up upgrading their subscription sooner or later. 

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/fJBp-Z341gOeLF5BnQ1gbwJk-3Kbs8cWMwD8V4Fb2NQHg452gfhO05jIjUkoV2WRrmCoOUsFU4ldiHrhOFSxwCeviYQ21_ytXv8R__OCwBXFsb0pvdYZbERBfnOY6nyQ45DCHKP4)

Considering everything it offers, Kajabi’s prices are quite competitive. All three plans include a 14-day trial period and 0% transaction fees. 

It is also important to keep in mind that this is not just an expense, but an investment.

This is a platform that will help you make a lot of money. If you use it well, $160 per month will feel like a bargain. 

## Is Kajabi worth the money?

Well, to answer this question you must consider how many additional investments you will have to make if you don’t choose Kajabi. 

Other platforms might be cheaper but you will end up paying for at least 4 or 5 additional subscriptions. 

Let’s have a look at the following chart:

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tu-c4qyw8iA-vEdF0prGt8kGH2RdFf6QYJbn8LFSS1o8PINlDuVvRu153elXgS1_FFkgV-KnlTmmskdEeByOzxQFgsYXSaqFH3XkDLBxzrHo_JMvZSZAJACXDfAuPehe34CWWJmP)

How many of these services do you need, and how much do they cost? 

Well, there’s your answer.
