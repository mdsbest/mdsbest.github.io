## Products & Services

HostUs offers a variety of hosting plans to fit a variety of purposes. The following is a list of the products & services available.

### Shared Hosting Plans

Those just starting out in the world of business, bloggers, or hobbyists can most profit from these programs. They're the cheapest and easiest to put up, making them the most popular. 

However, the downside is that multiple websites are forced to share a single physical server. As a result, if a server goes down, all of the websites that are hosted on it would be unavailable. 

As a result, all websites housed on the server share in the server's performance. HostUs, on the other hand, uses the latest & most powerful servers using Intel Xeon CPUs as well as a minimum of 32GB of RAM to run their services. This implies that all websites will run smoothly and there will be no stuttering or buffering. 

Starter package: Small personal websites can benefit from this. For a monthly fee of $2 ($15 yearly), you may get 5GB of SSD storage, 10 addon domains, 100GB of bandwidth, 10 email accounts, 10 FTP accounts, plus shared IP addresses. 

Premium package: This is a good option for small companies or huge blogs. For $5 a month ($35 a year), you get 20GB of SSD storage, limitless bandwidth, unrestricted addon domains, unlimited free FTP accounts, and an unlimited number of email addresses. 

Premium plus package: For large enterprises, this package is the best option. For $10 a month, you get 70GB of SSD storage, limitless bandwidth and add-on domains as well as limitless FTP accounts, email addresses, plus a dedicated IP. Executive package: This is for those who want to run many websites. 

A dedicated IP address, 120GB of SSD storage, unrestricted bandwidth, unrestricted addon domains, unrestricted FTP accounts, and unrestricted email accounts are all included in the monthly fee of $15 ($115 yearly).

### VPS Hosting

Virtual Private Server (VPS) is the greatest option for organizations with several websites running various scripts because of its many advantages over shared hosting. 

When it comes to virtual private servers (VPS), the setup is similar to a shared hosting setting where multiple sites were hosted on the same computer. In the event of a server failure, other servers would not be affected. This is the primary benefit of this option. 

Furthermore, because bandwidth and other resources are not shared, a website that consumes a lot of resources cannot adversely affect other websites' performance. Finally, you have a lot more flexibility over the server setting to work with. 

On your VPS, you have a number of options for configuring the operating system. HostUs has a variety of plans to choose from, including the following:

- Unmanaged OpenVZ VPS plan: With HostUs' unmanaged OpenVZ VPS hosting, you can take use of strong servers, RAID10+ hardware configuration, and a rechargeable backup to ensure that you're constantly connected.

Dedicated IP addresses start at $21.95 per month for 6 CPU cores with 200GB disk space, 8GB vSwap, 8GB RAM,  and 500GB bandwidth. The lowest price is $5.95/quarter for 1 CPU core with 512MB RAM.

- Unmanaged KVM VPS plan: For the optimum efficiency of your virtual server, you’ll receive in-breed features including resource isolation supported by high-performance servers with these servers. A bespoke control panel is provided to you while the servers remain unmanaged. A KVM-05 server having 1 core, 512MB RAM 25GB storage space,  and 750GB bandwidth costs $4.35/month, while a KVM-12 server having 8 cores, 12,288MB RAM, 220GB storage space, 8TB bandwidth, and 1 IPv4 & 1 IPv6 address costs $99.95/month.

- Managed OpenVZ VPS plan: There are several perks to this plan, including the ability to have a specialist administer your OpenVZ VPS server for you. As a result, you can focus on operating your business instead of worrying about the technical details of maintaining a server. MVZ-1024 servers with 1GB RAM, 50GB disk space, 2 virtual CPU cores, 1TB bandwidth, 3 IPv4 and 6 IPv6 addresses cost $49.95 per month, while MVZ-8192 servers with 8GB RAM, 6 virtual CPU cores, 200GB disk space, 3TB bandwidth, and 3 IPv4 and 3 IPV6 addresses cost $109.95 per month.

## Customer Feedback

“Exceptional support staff. I screwed up a website update on my VPS, and I know it's my responsibility. An email was sent to ask for aid... They went above and above to help me get my site up and running again, and then upgraded it to the current version. The best part? They didn't charge a penny for all the work they performed! To put it simply, I'm overjoyed.” -R. Johnston

“HOSTUS.US has no regard for the customer. Working with them was a huge mistake. Worst service! First and foremost, you'll get a response within 2-5 days. Time management is a major issue for them, as well as a significant amount of down time. I've had one of my accounts down for two weeks. There is, as far as I can tell, no support for this awful support. HOSTUS.US should not be used!” -Tom

 “Low-cost service with no uptime or uptime assurances. After my data was deleted and my hosting and dns services were abruptly terminated, I considered the positive aspects of my experience with Hostus.us being compromised. The only option I have is to switch providers. If you're willing to put up with delayed customer service and sluggish servers, this is a good option. You'll save money, but you'll also lose out in the end.” -Chris Jay

 "I was looking for a low-cost cPanel host in the United States. I had to wait a few days after placing my order before receiving the cPanel login information, but I was able to move hosts and start using HostUS within a single day.” -Marlon Dorsett

 “The process of signing up for HostUS VPS hosting took a few hours, and I received the welcome email afterward. To manage the VPS, I also bought CPanel, which required a support order request to be approved before I could buy it. Because of the extended wait after the purchase was placed, I wrote a ticket to inquire if the cpanel order would be approved or not. Not a word from them. After an entire day of waiting for a response from customer service, I wrote another ticket requesting a refund and canceling my subscription. Later, customer service informs me that my many inquiries were pointless and just serve to delay my progress in the queue. They asked me what my problem was, so I explained it and have been waiting for a response from CPanel for many hours. At this point, I only want a refund, which I've asked from customer service a number of times, since I'm running out of patience waiting for help. Despite the firm's claim to be situated in Delaware, my bank informed me that this was a UK-based company when I tried to make an order. Except for a little project or assistance, I'd stay away from it.” -Junior Guru
