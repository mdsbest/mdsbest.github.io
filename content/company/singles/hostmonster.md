AVOID HOST MONSTER

As much as you possible can, I would recommend avoiding Web.com companies. From Network Solutions to Hostmonster - nothing good comes from Web.com -- **Avoid**.

## HostMonster Walkthrough

Founded in 1996,[HostMonster](https://serp.ly/hostmonster/)is among the oldest web hosting providers in the industry. HostMonster is  
a hosting provider situated in Provo, Utah. Endurance International Group (EIG), which also owns the popular web  
hosting companies such as Bluehost, HostGator, and iPage, purchased the company in 2010.

HostMonster's hosting options include cPanel, an easy WordPress installation, 24/7 customer support, email accounts,  
and a free domain. HostMonster is a low-cost provider of shared hosting and VPS hosting options, as well as  
dedicated servers. Its goal is to give high-quality solutions to people, small businesses, and those looking for  
reliable alternatives and supported by excellent customer service.

## Getting Started With HostMonster

To get started, head to the[HostMonster](https://serp.ly/hostmonster/)site.

![](/images/a4d23b54-fd56-45be-93b9-a9f83d150cc8.png)

First impression? Minimalist design. On HostMonster's homepage, you will be greeted with their cheapest hosting plan  
starting at $4.95 a month.

![](/images/39f6dfde-70ce-4c01-bb48-1076c8bf1b86.png)

Take note that this is only shared hosting. However, if you have a specific hosting plan in mind, you can simply  
scroll down, and you'll find the other hosting services HostMonster offers. Shared Web Hosting - a cPanel shared  
hosting plan

VPS  
Hosting - a high-performance VPS hostingDedicated Hosting - a fully-managed dedicated server hostingFor this  
HostMonster review, we always go for their cheapest hosting service - the Basic Shared Hosting plan. With this plan,  
you get one website, 50GB of website space, unlimited bandwidth, standard performance, a free SSL certificate, a  
free domain name, five parked domains, 25 subdomains, five email accounts, and 100MB of email storage.

![](/images/af1299a3-1559-4797-b9f1-fe59d47063f1.png)

![](/images/7447be2c-dd67-4f0b-b88a-3215cf16a329.png)

If you've already chosen a plan to subscribe to, simply click Select. Doing this will redirect you to the[Sign Up](https://serp.ly/hostmonster/)page.Here,  
you need to set up your domain, or if you already have an existing one, you can simply type it in here as well.  
Afterward, click Next.

![](/images/b18c3b6f-09fc-4c33-9963-ed707bb17fe5.png)

Doing this will take you to the next step, where you create your actual HostMonster account. Here, you need to  
provide your name, phone number, address, and email address.

![](/images/d334bc35-1667-491b-be6e-6e54afd41570.png)

As you scroll down this page, you will see the Package Information tab and the Package Extras tab. Here, you can  
choose your billing cycle - Annually, Biannually, and Triannually. Moreover, the Package Extras is where you can  
purchase additional security and plugins for your website to operate efficiently, such as Domain Privacy, CodeGuard,  
SEO tools, SiteBackup Pro, and SiteLock Security.

![](/images/f72f4722-480f-4f98-8de4-7f89f6467f3c.png)

Next would be  
the Payment Information tab, where, as the name implies, you settle your payment for the specific plan you chose.  
HostMonster offers two payment options - via Credit Card or through PayPal.

Afterward, click Submit.

You should receive your account information through e-mail after signing up for a new hosting account with  
HostMonster. If your order application is valid and complete, your hosting account will be ready to use within a few  
minutes. It will provide all the necessary information to begin uploading files to the space and configuring the  
website. Then you're all set!

## Using and Managing Your Website on HostMonster

![](/images/a6ff3003-0033-447a-b338-ee116edb9348.png)

Here, as usual, you need to type in the login credentials that HostMonster has sent you via email. You have two  
options when logging in - Hosting Login and Webmail Login.

![](/images/6754ab54-5dc9-4590-bc52-917543f182a7.png)

Once you have successfully logged in, you will instantly see your account dashboard. Here, you will be provided with  
a range of sections in managing your accounts, such as helpful resources, emails, websites, and much more.

## HostMosnter Control Panel

Customers can access a cPanel control panel through HostMonster. cPanel is well-known for its versatility and  
security, and that it has become an industry standard. Currently, cPanel is regarded as one of the best solutions  
accessible for consumers who require absolute control over their websites and accounts.

cPanel provides a number of simple wizards that can help you set up new pages or even a shopping cart. It also allows  
you to manage email, your account, your domain, and other complex capabilities. To access cPanel on your account,  
log in to your HostMonster account, then click the Advanced tab from the side navigation menu to the left.

![](/images/33251682-e99c-42eb-a6f7-87f421818b5c.png)

Imagine cPanel to be the “control tower” of your web hosting platform, as that is where you would go to do tasks such  
as:

- Monitor the resource consumption of your website

- Manage your email accounts

- Use FTP to upload files.

- Create backups of your site

- Manage the payment for your account

If you're experienced with cPanel, you will be pretty familiar with HostMonster; the company makes no changes to  
cPanel.

## Email

One of the benefits of hosting your domain name with a cPanel-enabled web host is the ability to create bespoke email  
accounts for that domain. All of this takes place in the Email area of cPanel.

![](/images/2116aa4b-5090-48c2-b0b6-9334cbbfa36f.png)

As you can see, there are numerous tools available, including those for creating new emails, configuring forwarders  
and autoresponders, dealing with spam, and more. Your HostMonster hosting plan includes access to an email server.

You can create email accounts using your website's domain name, a free web-based email client, or your preferred  
email software. Click on Email Accounts to acquire access.

## Email Accounts

After clicking on the Email Accounts tab, you will be sent to your email accounts page. Your recent emails will be  
listed here.

## File Management

Through the files section of cPanel, you may backup your cPanel account, view and alter files stored in your account,  
evaluate your disk consumption, and create and manage FTP accounts.

## File Manager

The cPanel File Manager, instead of an FTP client, allows you to control your website via HTTP, precisely like an  
internet browser.

![](/images/d4beaf10-35e9-4111-ad3f-c8f4907ddf35.png)

This is a relatively simple task. As the name says, the File Manager is where you may handle your files. You can use  
this page to transfer, edit, upload, alter, remove, and restore your documents.

## Backup

Using the Backup tool, you can store and save your files, databases, forwarders, and filters to a backup file. If you  
are unfamiliar with cPanel or file backups, you should instead use the Backup Wizard interface.

## Disk Usage

![](/images/4bfbf1aa-2053-4ec0-8577-817d48ff38d0.png)

Your account's total disk space usage comprises all data, including website files, MySQL databases, and email  
messages. When you log into cPanel, you'll see a summary of your disk space usage on the right side.

## FTP Accounts

FTP allows you to enable or disable accounts from accessing your hosting account using FTP. To upload files to your  
website, you can employ FTP. You can specify which directories the new user will have access to and how much space  
they can consume.

## Domains

If you wish to add a new domain name - the one you just purchased to your hosting account, modify your existing  
domains, or set up subdomains, go to the Domains area of cPanel.

![](/images/a3ff7a08-9725-4a73-9dcd-8ff6b8af4a39.png)

To add a domain name to your cPanel and, therefore, your hosting package, go to the Domains section and click on  
“Addon Domains.” An addon domain is a fancy word for an ordinary domain name that can be used to establish a fully  
working website — this means you can host many domain names from the same control panel. When you add a new domain  
to your account, cPanel will also generate a related subdomain.

## Databases

Many modern websites hardly survive without a database, which operates discreetly behind the scenes and manages the  
website's content. In simpler terms, the database stores all of your website's data, including all pages, posts, and  
user information.

![](/images/97233f6a-b988-4907-a24e-87e86418fe4a.png)

As you may imagine by now, cPanel includes a quite comprehensive tool for creating and managing databases.

## Metrics

It is vital for your business and marketing to keep track of various statistics for your website. You can check a  
variety of data, track mistakes, and monitor bandwidth usage in the Metrics section. This section enables you to  
narrow down where your traffic is coming from, how many visitors you have, and which parts of your website are  
accessed.

## Security

Keeping your website secure is one of the most important things you can do. You can use the tools in this category to  
limit SSH access, block IP addresses, and inhibit the hotlinking of your images. This is also where you can manage  
the security certifications for your website.

## Software

You can boost your website's features by going to the software category. There are two important tools offered here  
to help you configure PHP on your website. MultiPHP Manager lets you specify which PHP version is running on a given  
site. The MultiPHP INI Editor lets you make more detailed changes, such as enabling certain PHP options and  
modifying variables.

![](/images/a8b5a6ed-d628-4d95-935c-5ef311ac9122.png)

Softaculous simplifies the installation of popular website software such as WordPress and Drupal. Softaculous can be  
used to try numerous types of software and to get started constructing WordPress sites.

## Advanced

This category contains activities that are not frequently done yet are useful for modification. For example, the Cron  
Jobs tool will allow you to create unique Error Pages and schedule actions.

## Preferences

![](/images/f6d36996-710b-46af-9258-fb09906783ce.png)

When you first log in to cPanel, go to the Preferences section and update your contact information and password.  
Various aspects of cPanel can be customized in the Preferences area. Under Change Language, for instance, you can  
change the display language; you can also update your Contact Information and possibly even reset your cPanel  
password in this section.

## HostMonster Website Builder

## Concrete5

Concrete5 is one of the site builders accessible. This widely used open content management system lets you design  
your website rapidly with a drag-and-drop builder. It also includes a standard user permissions structure to govern  
access to your site, allowing you to restrict who can and cannot make modifications to your webpage if you have a  
development team.

Additionally, Concrete5 is search engine optimized so that it will improve the performance of your site right away.

## Weebly

![](/images/9421d82d-6cf3-473f-af27-0e7b4a3bfb5f.png)

The Weebly site builder is also accessible; however, users would have to pay an extra fee to access it if they want  
anything beyond the basic version. Weebly, similar to Concrete5, is search engine friendly. It has a drag-and-drop  
feature and a range of trendy designs to get you started with your site.

However, because the basic version only permits six pages on your site, you'll need to upgrade if you want to use it  
for larger bases. Unless you switch to the professional subscription, it also sets a price for each activity on your  
site. With its free plan, Weebly provides various adaptive and professional business themes.

## Apps Installer

## Softaculous Apps Installer

![](/images/68e496a9-ea58-4922-8605-c0ccdab06480.png)

HostMonster includes the Softaculous Apps Installer, which allows you to easily install, update, and uninstall  
programs, saving you time from individually uploading installation files and setting databases in cPanel. You can  
install your future website, online store, and a few more features with just a few taps.

## Mojo Marketplace

HostMonster offers Mojo Marketplace, which includes email marketing solutions like DaDa Mail, which starts at $34.95  
a year and allows you to deliver email-based newsletters to a subscriber list. Mojo Marketplace also includes  
Magento, an e-commerce application that allows you to quickly design an appealing store by dragging and dropping  
page elements.

## WordPress Themes

When you install WordPress with the Softaculous App Installer, you have over 8,000 free themes to select from in a  
variety of styles and classifications. However, if you prefer to start from scratch, you can do that as well.

## HostMonster Customer Support

Excellent customer support is something you should seek in a hosting provider. If a company does not have it, stay  
away from them. What if your website went down while your most critical customer was browsing it? You will then lose  
a valued client.

Worse, when this occurs, the support personnel is unavailable to assist you. What a shame. Given the extremely  
negative customer feedback on HostMonster's customer service, I was hesitant to take the plunge.

![](/images/97c66127-e4e8-4b8d-b2a7-509ecd4d1c3d.png)

Furthermore, HostMonster has its own help center, which comprises articles and tutorials with solutions to potential  
difficulties. There are over 500 searchable articles to assist you in obtaining any information you seek.

Honestly, I didn't find the answers to my questions here, several links are provided, but once you click it, you will  
only be redirected to a blank page. And if you are a visual learner, their tutorials do not have pictures on them,  
so that's a disadvantage.

![](/images/51d7086f-25a6-45ea-b820-a297e5c57753.png)

The HostMonster support available to its customers comprises a telephone support line to the tech support that is  
open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. More phone lines are available for invoicing, sales, terms of service  
compliance, and verification. Each of these help channels also offers live chat.

## Support Tickets

You can also initiate a support ticket and, quite significantly, monitor the ticket history. This helps in tracking  
the status of any support request you submit. Keeping track of your support queries enables you to have peace of  
mind while troubleshooting.

## HostMonster Online Community

HostMonster has a Facebook page, a Twitter account, and a Google Plus page, but these channels appear to be dormant.  
There is also a user forum where you may ask questions and engage with other members of the HostMonster community.

## Validation Tokens

When HostMonster communicates with their clients, they use a validation token generation system. This is a unique  
number that can be obtained when you are logged into your account or when you use a mobile authentication tool like  
Google Authenticator.

This means that the HostMonster team can request a validation token and immediately confirm that they are speaking  
with a genuine client rather than someone who has obtained your personal information and is impersonating you.

The validation token is an excellent concept for keeping your account secure. Mobile banking services commonly  
utilize Validation token technology, although it is uncommon to see it as part of a hosting service.

## Buyer’s Guide For HostMonster

## HostMonster Pricing and Plans

Shared Web Hosting plans start at $4.95/month.

![](/images/dea17884-1c7e-411d-adb2-71a4d478fa53.png)

HostMonster's shared web hosting plans are mostly focused on here. Options for VPS (Virtual Private Server) and  
dedicated server hosting are tucked away in the site's footer. These are hosting solutions for large websites,  
including dynamic small-scale business websites or influential blogs.

Should your website outgrows the limits of the shared web hosting plan you originally subscribed for, HostMonster  
could upgrade its solutions. The free domain offer remains available with these plans, and all packages above the  
base level include two IP addresses.

The Linux-based Basic shared web hosting package, which starts at $9.49 per month with a one-year agreement, comes  
with a free domain name that you can retain as long as you use HostMonster, a free domain transfer, 50GB of storage,  
unlimited monthly data transfers, five email accounts, and the ability to host a single website.

With a one-year contract, the HostMonster Plus package starts at $12.49 per month and includes 150GB of storage, the  
option to host 50 domains, 100 email accounts, and spam prevention. With a dedicated IP address, an SSL certificate,  
and unlimited site hosting and email, the Prime package, which starts at $14.99 per month with a one-year contract,  
outperforms all of HostMonster's shared hosting plans. VPS Hosting plans start at $19.99/month.

![](/images/39f6dfde-70ce-4c01-bb48-1076c8bf1b86.png)

VPS web  
hosting is available in four distinct packages, with dual-core, triple-core, and quad-core CPUs and scalable RAM,  
data, and bandwidth. The VPS hosting makes use of cloud technologies and includes an upgraded cPanel with multiple  
account administration. The CentOS operating system is used on the VPS hosting, and the server has root access.

The VPS hosting, just like HostMonster shared hosting, is instantaneously configured so that as soon as you finish  
registering, your VPS server is available to be used.

- The Standard plan costs $29.99 per month and offers 2GB of RAM, 30GB of storage, and 1TB of monthly data  
    transfers.

- The Enhanced package, which costs $59.99 per month, increases the RAM, storage, and monthly data transfers to  
    4GB, 60GB, and 2TB, correspondingly.

- The $89.99 per month Premium plan follows, with 6GB of RAM, 90GB of storage, and 2TB of monthly data transfers.

- The Ultimate option costs $119 per month and includes 8GB of RAM, 120GB of storage, and 3TB of monthly data  
    transfers.

- Dedicated Hosting plans start at $79.99/month.

![](/images/af1299a3-1559-4797-b9f1-fe59d47063f1.png)

HostMonster's  
premium hosting option is dedicated server hosting. There are three plans, each of which includes one server  
with four cores and eight threads. Intel Xeon processors power the servers, and the dedicated servers grow up  
the number of cache capacities, data, bandwidth, RAM, and IPs available.

You get a free domain for a year, much like with VPS hosting, and the dedicated server runs CentOS. If you're  
thinking about getting one of HostMonster's dedicated servers, which start at $109 a month, you have a few options.

The servers may be configured with a Linux-based operating system as well as up to 1,000GB of hard drive space, 16GB  
of RAM, and 15TB of data transfers per month—almost the same specifications as Bluehost's dedicated hosting service.

## Server Speed and Uptime

Server speed is critical for ensuring the integrity of your website. Users find it extremely inconvenient when  
websites take a long time to load. Unfortunately, HostMonster does not guarantee uptime.

They claim to do their utmost to maintain a stable network and server uptime, but they do not have any SLAs. The most  
annoying aspect of this is that there is no reimbursement when things go wrong because there is no guarantee. Based  
on UKWebHostReview's uptime tests, which they conducted over six months, they were thrilled to achieve an overall  
uptime of 99.96 percent. This is just over the industry average; therefore, HostMonster squeaked by a hair's  
breadth.

![](/images/hosting.png)

HostMonster, on the other hand, posed some pretty troubling response times on their website. There were moments when  
the reaction time exceeded 3 seconds, which is really concerning. However, the average response time did settle down  
to around 700 ms, which isn't ideal but adequate.

## Security and Backups

HostMonster's web hosting plans include a variety of security measures, such as antispam and hotlink prevention.  
However, if you want more advanced security, sign up for HostMonster's Business Plus subscription, including an SSL  
certificate and two types of antispam protection. For enhanced protection, HostMonster's email supports DomainKeys  
Identified Mail (DKIM) and Sender Policy Framework (SPF) authentication technology.

HostMonster offers an outstanding job of providing many security features such as Hotlink Protection, SSH Access, SSL  
support, regular site backups, and Spam Assassin Protection. Backups are the last line of defense in the fight  
against loss of data.

Whatever goes to your server and its files, you must have a backup that you can employ to undo any unwanted changes.  
Its security and peace of mind, which are something that almost all site owners need. Each HostMonster hosting  
package includes Site Backup Basic. The solution backs up your setup on a daily basis and allows you to rapidly  
recover website files. The drawback is that the Basic edition cannot restore the database.

Therefore, site Backup Pro is required if you require backups or additional features such as partial restorations.

## Features of HostMonster

- cPanel control panel - HostMonster's control interface is cPanel. This means you'll be able to install  
    WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal with a single click. In addition, you will have free webmail access, anti-spam  
    tools, and statistics.

## Final Thoughts

[Hostmonster](https://serp.ly/hostmonster/)is an  
excellent choice of web host, whether you are a newbie building your first personal website or a medium-sized  
business trying to expand.

With superb extra features like SEO and e-commerce functionality included by default, and also unlimited bandwidth  
and the highest levels of security, it's simple to recognize their two decades of experience amid the competition.

While their cost is relatively reasonable, they employ some of the most frequent web hosting tactics.

This means that their prices are lower if you sign up for a longer period of time, and then rise when you renew.  
Their performance was somewhat disappointing, and their response times worried us. We don't recommend HostMonster.

We don't trust HostMonster to provide a dependable and powerful web hosting service, especially given the terrible  
customer reviews. There are other web hosts that provide more reliable and robust performance. We hope this  
HostMonster review has been helpful in finding your web hosting company!
