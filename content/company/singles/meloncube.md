![Meloncube's Control Panel](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/XFekJrErw5IHY6iVvpk-3_wUTDnXLvM-Hmq1kd--WT4zH3whw2EmfucJ-MoWNRLmP-wW-I00OU2zXavjfNYXmorQBZHJArSIFQ8VtD6jIkr_1pSpiBc5lKUTRqFUwXXz1S84GIWBjq_5E66Uk9Dzun0)

### Uptime Monitor

A bandwidth utilization summary is included in the cPanel, which reveals how much bandwidth your website has consumed. It doesn't show you how much bandwidth you're using in real time. 

The data is gathered from server logs and evaluated on a regular basis. Keeping track of various and relevant website data is critical for your business and marketing. In the Metrics area, you may examine different statistics, track errors, and monitor bandwidth use. 

You won't always be able to determine whether traffic is rising or dropping in the normal course of running a website. 

Your webpage, or a component of your website, may, for example, be link to a popular site, temporarily increasing your bandwidth use.   

![MelonCube Hosting uptime monitor](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/LxF0fxUDpnth3xBNGs2mF9pcDIYijoJkSYfI86uuaJ1QqPRPCfhkJAdg6ltZWfwYKyi4fltnB6rudpNuz9ft1o_ZrocLZ3FJoLK1HfS9_lSy7mSl6P4m2vjlmG872Y5YhPrBClOc933NW5L9c48DlIU)

### Data Security

One of the most essential things you can do is keep your website safe. The resources in this category can be used to restrict SSH access, block IP addresses, and prevent picture hotlinking. This is also where you can manage your website's security certifications.

### Two-Factor Authentication

In enabling Two-Factor Authentication, you might want to log in to your control panel and click the profile tab. After that, you're just going to look to the left and click enable two-factor authentication.   

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/H2SMzMf5wDrkarDlR4UNCdVbh2paKUBe8T0XAlTmcTeJyx4OCo19G-x_y0srmx9cY-96M16HNgj-4tL7a7KTwhUnh3tsxSj1uVRVpjCZ_D9kZJI_cebQLk1wMa_UdLP0cKTuiQiKMjRPy8gXsuBC_Fw)

Once you've clicked two-factor authentication, you are going to scan the QR code with an authentication app. After you've scan the QR code, type in the six digit code that's given to you and confirm your password here. 

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/fBmjopqiT6_nm4LmWz5QEBTrfcjRvaf1-TD1Iy5FHbsXIGwz3Wo4HYsfTDadJ4DrIJTWzXp-Yzh6xnWOrqFP5uwXOMQdrT93gPU-OJJ_GcVT0AdwsuasimnSnC6n6yliPBjh5QIu06ZR8hd_X4T-sr4)

After that it is all said and done, next time you log into your multicraft panel, you'll be prompted to type in the 6 digit code given to you on your authenticator app. 

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/JvJiVEgAAbpyzO9Zm2_92btFEMu3wmkwz9cnS9gUDPnbxzMfB41737IbGXGc7n-UfYOIf3oDn1C5mGPX2c4BXXaydx7NfcXshcPM9kAaVsnjCrJoH-8Rwk43wtFdY70DmB16bZdwySVYxteqlZ8ucfE)

### Backup

It's important to note that Multicraft's backup method will only save the default world, nether, and end settings from your control panel. If you're using Multiverse, you'll need to unzip these files first. It will not back up any plugins or other data.

### Domains

You may add new domains to your account, set up parked domains, create subdomains, arrange redirects, and much more via the Domains page of cPanel. Before modifying cPanel, you need first set up a domain and connect it to your server. 

If you don't, merely putting it in cPanel won't help. It's simple to add an extra domain with cPanel. In general, you'll need to register the new domain, connect it to the right nameservers, and then add it to cPanel so it can be found.

## Databases

### MySQL Databases

MySQL is a free, open-source database management system that uses Structured Query Language (SQL), the most widely used language for generating, storing, and analyzing data in databases. MySQL is commonly used in conjunction with PHP, a widely used open-source general-purpose programming language. 

This utility simplifies the creation of new MySQL databases as well as the management of existing ones. 

You'll need to set up a database and a user to access it if you're developing a PHP-based software or any other application that needs a database.
