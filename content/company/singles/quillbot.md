MY RECOMMENDATION

[QuillBot Paraphrasing Tool](https://serp.ly/quillbot) is a marketable, reasonably priced tool that can be used to paraphrase any piece of information. It does this by utilizing “cutting-edge” AI. 

The main goal of the tool is to reword the material while keeping the sense of the original text by altering the sentence structure and substituting synonyms for terms.

In 2017, Rohit Gupta, Anil Jason, and David Silin—three computer science students—founded the company. Since then, they have been steadily expanding the product's features and raising its caliber.

QuillBot has a summarizing tool, as well as a grammar checker, in addition to the paraphrasing tool.

You might be astonished to learn that 10 million people use QuillBot to generate material efficiently, including writers, professionals, and students.

## Things to consider before buying QuillBot Paraphrasing Tool

A modest paraphraser character limit—you can only rewrite 700 characters at once for a free plan, and 10,000 characters for the premium—is the main reason why people look for QuillBot alternatives.

The fact that QuillBot does not ensure original content and offers no unique-ness indicator to reveal whether or not your fresh content is free of plagiarism is somewhat of a drawback.

QuillBot additionally lacks advanced paraphraser capabilities offered by its rivals, such as bulk rewriting, a customized Thesaurus, multimedia integration, a seed article database, multi-languages, unlimited nested spinning, and more.

The first excellent aspect of QuillBot is that you can use it right away without having to register and it provides a lot of value for free. Additionally, QuillBot is user-friendly and offers both automated and manual paraphrasing.

QuillBot includes 6 different paraphrasing styles and has several useful features like word protection, comparison modes, etc. QuillBot also provides an extension for Google Chrome, Google Docs, and Microsoft Word, so you can use them while writing in QuillBot's editor or while you write in those programs.

Last but not least, QuillBot provides additional writing tools in addition to the paraphrasing tool, including a grammar checker, summarizer, and citation generator.

To sum up, QuillBot is a good investment if you do not need a sophisticated paraphrase tool that can create original content free of plagiarism.

## QuillBot Premium Benefits

## Who is Quillbot intended for?

An intriguing tool that creatively applies AI is called Quillbot.

**If you write and publish your own books, we can think of two main reasons why you would want to look into Quillbot:**

1. Quillbot may help you save time compared to doing this manually if you frequently feel the need to simplify or formalize your writing.

2. The Quillbot summarizer tool could be useful in your approach if you need to handle a lot of research but don't want to go through everything by hand.

## Quillbot Features

There are numerous reasons why QuillBot is the most popular paraphrasing tool on the market. Several of the best features of this online service are highlighted below.

### Class leader in paraphrasing

QuillBot excels at what it is known for: paraphrasing. As a full-time blogger, I've evaluated many similar services, but none compare to QuillBot whenever it comes to rephrasing text without altering its meaning.

QuillBot's paraphraser can rewrite any text in a variety of ways, helping to ensure that you get the appropriate language, tone, and style for any occasion. Simply enter your text into the box, and the AI will create the best possible paraphrase from the original piece of writing.

### More than a w̶o̶m̶a̶n̶ a paraphraser

QuillBot's USP is its paraphraser, but it is not the only service it provides. QuillBot has some other features that appear to be essential for any writer, in addition to the rewriting tool.

QuillBot includes features such as Grammar Checker, Plagiarism Checker, Summarizer, Citation Generator, and Co-Writer. So, if you just get the QuillBot premium, you're getting not only the paraphraser but also some useful tools that would otherwise cost you money if you had to purchase them separately.

### 7 Modes

For paraphrasing your text, QuillBot provides a total of 7 different modes. While two of them (Standard and Fluency) are available in the free version, the remaining five modes are only available in the premium version.

1. **Standard**: Rewrites words in a consistent manner to preserve meaning.

3. **Fluency**: Ensures that text is readable and error-free.

5. **Formal**: This mode presents the text in a more refined and professional manner.

7. **Simple**: Displays text in an easy-to-understand format.

9. **Creative**: conveys ideas in novel ways that may alter their meaning.

11. **Expand**: Increases sentence length by adding more detail and depth.

13. **Shorten**: Removes unnecessary words to provide a clear message.

There are both free and premium versions available.

QuillBot is available in both free and paid versions. You can access the free version indefinitely and will not be charged a dime for it. However, there is no point in assuming that the premium version will include more features than the free version.

For instance, in the freemium model, you can only edit your text in two modes; the other five are locked. The plagiarism checker is also available only in the premium version. Continue reading to learn more about the pricing and to determine whether QuillBot premium is worthwhile.

### Other noteworthy features

The following are some of the additional features that distinguish QuillBot as an all-in-one solution for writers.

QuillBot premium includes a plagiarism checker, so you won't need to buy anything else to ensure the credibility of your work. The plagiarism checker in QuillBot detects duplicate content and shows the original sources that need to be credited.

  
QuillBot has a summarize feature that condenses articles, papers, or documents to their key points. The AI uses natural language processing to find important information while maintaining the original context.

  
Because QuillBot is a browser service, you can access it from any web browser. Furthermore, it integrates with Google Docs, Word Documents, and the Chrome Extension.

### Premium Pricing for QuillBot

Quillbot offers both a free and a premium plan. The free plan is indefinitely free, and you do not need to enter your [credit card](https://devinschumacher.com/secured-credit-cards/) information to join. Quillbolt, on the other hand, provides three kinds of premium plans based on the validity of the plan. You can select a month - to - month, semi-annual, or annual payment plan. Their prices are as follows:

- The monthly subscription fee is $9.95.

- The semi-annual plan is $39.95 for six months, or $6.66 per month.

- The annual subscription is $49.95, or $4.17 per month.

So, when compared to the monthly plan, the annual plan saves you 58%. And, if you want our advice, we recommend that you only subscribe to the annual plan because it is the most cost-effective.

| Standard and Fluency modes are available | Expand, Shorten, Formal, Simple, and Creative modes |

## Does Quillbot possess human-level expertise?

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5VTr5N-FO6jDbecJGjjOYRx9PeoxRKX00jhE_YwzxcnWjIFqIALW9UBY3jZYfyqJg9Z3fI34cN_Z8ztvdrQq5uL_2bI-KT-aV1fT99VRkEam5lnNWViaAwtHttkejlJyvPn-TxUFb_WAFYpKALfLFizyYWxWWDzlbLmGiPhlk6ulYjmbALA9GLr0RVTytA)

The main goal of Quillbot is to create artificial intelligence that can paraphrase at a human-level level.

The team's intentions and objectives are admirable, and CEO Rohan Gupta has indicated that they are more along the lines of a full-sentence thesaurus.

As a result, loading both paragraphs and entire articles to be rewritten works! However, before submitting or posting any of these anywhere, they should all be proofread.

## User Feedback

On Trustpilot, QuillBot has a rating of 4.1 stars on average compared to Grammarly's 3.3 stars, giving it a much higher total customer satisfaction score.

Looking at the reviews by star rating makes the superiority of QuillBot even more clear because there is a higher percentage of reviews that are 5 stars, as opposed to Grammarly, which has significantly fewer ratings that are primarily under 4 stars or lower at 2-3 star ratings.

This program is very well-liked by those who wish to [check their grammar](https://devinschumacher.com/grammar-checking-tools/) because of how simple it is to use and all of the features that make life easier while using it (such as showing examples and specific repairs rather than generic recommendations).

Grammarly provides advice for grammar, punctuation, sentence structure, and word choice that are specifically catered to the [writer's own writing](https://devinschumacher.com/best/ai-writing-software/) style, ensuring that your message is understood by the target audience. 

These Grammarly products provide authors with the chance to enhance their grammatical abilities because Grammarly covers everything required to enhance one's own particular grammar abilities.

## Pros and Cons of Quillbot

**After investigating the operations of Quillbot, let's list its main advantages and disadvantages from the viewpoint of a freelance writer:**

### Pros

- Positive application of AI summarizing software for research

- Free trial before purchasing the tool

### Cons

- The ability to paraphrase is only occasionally used by some

- Writers might use another program for their word checking

## Quillbot Extension for Chrome

There is a Quillbot Chrome Extension that is free to use!

Using cutting-edge AI, the paraphrasing tool in the QuillBot Chrome Extension can rewrite a phrase, a paragraph, or an entire article. This QuillBot extension can help you write better, use fewer words, and communicate more effectively.

## Quillbot Alternatives

We’ll compare QuillBot with its 3 best alternatives:

### Spin Rewriter

Since it uses ENL (Emulated Natural Language) and Convolutional Neural Network to rewrite the text, Spin Rewriter is one of the most potent article spinner and paraphrase tools on the market.

To simplify your work, you can use the sophisticated AI functionalities of this program.

Spin Rewriter has a feature for comparing two things side by side. With the help of this functionality, you may compare your old text with the newly formed one.

Despite being a useful piece of software, Spin Rewriter doesn't provide writers with as many possibilities as QuillBot. Although Spin Rewriter can only be used for paraphrasing, QuillBot is an "all-in-one" tool.

There is no way to compare it to QuillBot in terms of price. The price of Spin Rewriter, which is significantly higher than QuillBot at $47 monthly and $77 annually, prevents it from being affordable software for everyone.

### [Word AI](https://serp.ly/word-ai)

You may swiftly rewrite articles with Word AI, which functions similarly to QuillBot. Along with paraphrasing your material, WordAi also has a patented artificial intelligence engine that, as the name suggests, evaluates the context of your original text.

Like QuillBot, a lot of bloggers, scholars, and other professionals use this tool since it is simple to use, supports several spin forms, and has a big user base.

Pricing-wise, it's highly pricey, similar to the Spin Rewriter. Only a small number of use cases are available, and not everyone has the money to subscribe to a premium service.

### Chimp Rewriter

With the aid of artificial intelligence and natural language processing, Chimp Rewriter rewrites and paraphrases your material. Additionally, the use of these technologies guarantees the best possible quality for the content produced.

Like a few other QuillBot rivals, Chimp Rewriter enables you to rewrite in a wide range of tongues—12 to be exact. Therefore, if you're a blogger and you're serving an identical post, they can use Chimp Rewriter with ease.

There is a small price difference between the two; QuillBot is the greatest option because it is the least expensive, but Chimp Rewriter is also not bad considering its cost.

## The Best Paraphrasing Tool is Quillbot, why is that?

There are many paid paraphrase programs available that provide in-text word replacement options. These article rewriters provide multiple replacement suggestions for each word, each of which is encased in curly brackets.

Consider the topic of surfacing (surface, floor, flooring). Other tools work by replacing the words with new synonyms, but the phrase structure remains the same.

BORING!

Let’s look at why QuillBot is the best paraphrasing tool out there today. 

Artificial intelligence is used by Quillbot to reword sentences so they may withstand plagiarism checks and provide distinctive content styles.

Quillbot does all the labor-intensive work when you use progressive optimization to expand your content.

Now, this is what you want out of a paraphrasing tool!

## Final Thoughts

The features in QuillBot are something that I would celebrate for life because most competitors only focus on the grammar aspect. Still, QuillBot stepped ahead and delivered a user-friendly experience with zero lagging. 

In my experience with QuillBot, I also noticed that QuillBot is trying to keep up with frequent updates and is changing according to the users’ understanding and reviews.

I am sure you can expect a lot of cool features in the future in QuillBot. Go ahead, step out of the shell and give QuillBot a try! You will be surprised by the results!
