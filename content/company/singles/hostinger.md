Cloud Hosting - A faster hosting solution with the simplicity of using a shared hosting 

![Hostinger web hosting solutions (Cloud)](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/nqrAwCgiwTOuWkHT0z1JZjl03TIWZMp7XFc-fyNNOK5oeDn9-J3QRv-wPWF2SUNV7P3c15pX7dj2XoHs2667z717PnQVaJeslUL2Tccm8fZweJu94ohe0dJ5xrSTWTEm_83K-d-9jAunCLNVTgIBnGQ)

As always, we will be getting the cheapest plan - Single Shared Hosting.

The Single Website Process

This hosting plan has everything we need to get our website up and running. We get 30GB of disk space, 100GB of bandwidth, one email address, and support for a single webpage. Since we'll be using just one site, we don't need dedicated servers because we won't need unlimited traffic nor support for unlimited websites.

To start the sign-up process, click Select - this applies to whichever hosting package you want. You will be redirected to the shopping cart; always take note of the plan you want to purchase because if you're only buying for the sake of testing it out for a short amount of time, the prices will be higher. Step 1: Choose a 

Period 

![Hostinger subscription period selection](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/lvbcX8Pk6wbCrTmWUiJzH1qg6I4l8lTKOKtVdjNBO5xIdBiVVoGegcR8hJ7wu_vri8Ss9oP6iDuTePXdYXZtvtXCHSCKyMSq9aZZgbbGoViZB6SFguWxlSwhjUwcon5ex4MsLpFBHQfReaO_GWEboLE)

As mentioned earlier, you have to read the description of each plan carefully, especially the number of months. Step 2: Create your account 

![Create an account screen](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/iUKYChcWBDduUO2cS57OC3HAfyA3EjaVkMIG-lRmjJ6EnfSCSGn6mWrhYBXs6uKV6JNS_wC-iSqYpG7ip1u-Gl-TF3Oj95Xi7YYYTS0DkKLrFKPH4VUccQiVa1OjAa2rrrYlJ26YYyR4OFul_dLo_WY)

Here, you will have the option to input your email address, or you can simply link it to Facebook, Github, or Google. Step 3: Select payment 

![Payment method selection](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6Eab33_8m3VcNPbBOr6vGq-mzSLI9cE6L1SXrcXCNtVdTagDfhMqfeJdp_nlNQRJ-EuUEOTzCWdh8O697f6SR08ZHg8yUruMY9hfHp2rgseuFO5J2ave0jApOL7zSDFKQwnhA4lNV5vhIVqNZsgsPi4)

Hostinger offers a wide range of payment options, unlike other web hosts. Here, you can choose a couple of payment methods including Credit Card, PayPal, CoinGate, and Google Pay. 

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/OW7o_PJJ9YYjkkhWHX8Vc6Bhai5vdRZjb5bI-hoxZuhsiBTUs19RYLVilpgb2tBqPk47Dv3_PBXsfeF_5OinaxVNNSa1-DxUH5Afa5DbF1rInz6UsEgckEPQMf4kxzuqxVSh6HOswlO4Ch8-SdBBX24)

Hostinger currently has an 85% off promo, and can I just say, this is such a great deal! You get to host your website for 48 months and pay only $66.72? Just wow! 

![Hostringer 'payment received' message](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/DwDReJJrJoUzA3OPZXZ4RUCzEmrfI0aDND-W5qUwbmSd2gAaomVVghYtgxlGtej83XRywftc4pB9pYFYvSNXJrKJ5i4c6dZ-UDMSQJmb96DKatiOQoKwquC5z9K7RWd3KZwCGpBtVuKqPP9QcKOzd6w)

You should be notified that your payment has been successful after which you can proceed to log in to your account. You're all set!

## Using and Managing Your Website on Hostinger

Head to the [Login page](https://serp.ly/hostinger) to gain access to the dashboard and control panel. 

![Hostinger log in screen](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/y3zwm6_gbImP6pzLHy0qohGD-5El4UHG8az0x-LDgO60HRQaM4Yz1iFtlVndycVjuI2tGn7zKML-m9eWR2WJNr8Hb7PA4h8MNi4nr0gW-3BmCUekq5Jbio7fbxSjoHufBqDBFpps8PFTAsLjeUD0obw)

Here, you need to input the email and password of your account; after that, click Log In. After logging in to your account, you will be asked to complete your domain order. You have the option to create a new domain or transfer your existing one on this page. 

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/0jacKXdiNBy5e7_s8xxrnuVK-r5evWQ_IOdVqlkgvtYjImcMMZfzGbO5m9dW15pquAB20Tx6_mKSdfKwfnZ-rFKVoYefOchFRi9VQIOg74HCNk-24AS-RlNUXtbPyqhHAgsWjMpphRSm6nN1DkU8uHk)

Below is what you call the Member's area; this was created with the user's experience in mind. As a result, it is pretty simple to browse all of the tools required to manage your hosting account. 

![Various user options](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qvLI_GePwC7sShnFocHEXsflqph60qsc0e6nL-uqCCe0AA_WSxRHzaQNmjFQ0uRQ9QdWhtMbXvYE2pIDSc9FGv4xrE28EJ2osTgzEcLfJF38-XzpR7QLxzR2YcLwr9AEwnwcKR0fweleItv3i4LZElw)

## Hostinger Panel

![Hostinger hPanel](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_ESviXRId2uQbiRm_E-5KBGMeIJOtIk9UfJhGi49cvImVS2vFsjPczZy-X-QFsXRPsejtK2Pd2E6NOVdph4Pb6acrVVp3ic5bwXPQ7r5mAav6doEQiBWOT7PgJsd7gJObKu-Qspvuaq3rq-bkobUhX4)

What exactly is hPanel? Hostinger's experts developed this control panel for their users. It is intended for use on Linux. At the time, hPanel could only be used for shared hosting. hPanel appears to be a more convenient alternative to cPanel. 

For example, since all of the selections are visible on the front page, a secondary menu displays on the left if you click on one of them. As a result, navigating across sections is straightforward. 

This control panel includes just about all the essential features, such as domain and email administration, DNS zone editor, file and database manager, and so forth. You could also manage account security by creating keys for files, blocking IP addresses, and configuring hotlink protection. 

Aside from these choices, the key distinction is the ability to manage all of your items in a single panel. For instance, you can see your payment history, purchase new hosting services, and upgrade existing ones.

### Home

The Home tab is where you can set up and manage your services. 

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UfXyND1YMmrffLZZ4v5Bi6uKCUEpKJQLDE4dg95EKMbsLmyNiuG5nlVkatYfYx8lhgG9ACaN45dZMh1kysJ2qS4C__23mDyy-Hj6BU3jtjq1sbuvY-AVsLnWWfjdxxYX9_hzBA35Mpn2yYlEHwEKPVI)

### Hosting

This section displays all of your Shared, Cloud, or WordPress hosting plans. On top of that, you'll be able to Manage, Renew, and Upgrade these as well as add new websites from there. Once you select the Hosting tab in the Menu Bar, a list of hosting options will appear. 

For other settings, click the Manage button next to your domain name. Numerous features related to your websites, such as WordPress, Order Details, Accounts, and Emails, will appear on a different page. 

Domains, Website Builders, Files with File Manager, and Backups are all available. In addition, FTP Accounts, Databases, advanced, and many other tools are also available.

### WordPress

WordPress is the most popular website builder out there and installing it by using Hostinger is pretty easy. If your WordPress site is already running, you can access its interface by clicking the button. 

You will then be routed to your WordPress dashboard. Alternatively, you can go to 'yourdomainname.com/wp-login'. You can also have multiple WordPress sites with Hostinger but this will cost extra.

### Orders

Inside the Orders section of WordPress, you may view your order details, renew hosting and domain information, change your plan to another Hostinger hosting plan, as well as configure your site's primary domain.

### Account

Under the Order tab of your account, there will be two visible options.

In the Emails category, you'll find items including Email Accounts, Email Forwarders, Catch-All Emails, Auto Responders, and Mail Servers Control. This section is predominantly used for managing your Email account.

### Domains

This section is all about domains; you can renew, transfer, freeze, or unlock your domains and also buy additional ones or manage DNS Zone for existing ones. 

![Hostinger domain options](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/o3FaVSEheJEGdrNwYAWc1jptfjNhhL6fjFbKk7VO-Ct_vTEa4pUgY7iJes8qMrTzkmKlvPaiXfcKDj5iomHdsNh6xn5LEWuLzgvtSJB4yFKUcG_xgF6kcPlzcpYt-SfjR7DREjPvgP3TRPEWCqMr0TI)

File Manager 

![Files screen](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/BXtsf-OMT7MRT8SPBPcNIh3IB8U6q3f5B6HtaxbTDewFO1vsDx7w2XXSNag0clPHw0wMQwnFwyDHrtGH6ZFSrlpKEo723ia2PsyNnpRUriEzUdFHVh8Z2qMT9LoQfXLibb1ll3cvuzkijTnthwk15UQ)

In the Files section, you'll find the File Manager which is used to handle all of your website's files, including HTML, CSS, and JS, as well as PHP and database files. These files are shown in directories, allowing you to conveniently manage them. Backups Users can efficiently manage their website backups in the Backups section. 

Hostinger offers daily backups for free but you can also purchase the full package for more control over the backup process. FTP Accounts In the FTP Accounts section, you can add or remove other people who use or control your site's hosting services.

### Databases

MySQL Databases

![Databases section](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/9ZtsheXBABKXAzksfnuKYxSmfGeJ8YBb1wzjgjSgjP7mfswWM02zkmjDuFKkvKnfC2D30u_RTboqvUCUm61-5o7fLIHtnHkXtPDRzHmf7rjiEPgzUSSeaazLIwonZTk29hbHcqgOj9hxdGbCspgxK-M) 

In the databases section, you have control over your site's databases, which are hosted for free by Hostinger. You can build or remove a database, as well as use functions that are predominantly for more advanced users. 

phpMyAdmin You could also manage the list of phpMyAdmin databases straight in the phpMyAdmin section as well as provide hassle-free accessibility from the Hostinger panel.

### Advanced

Many alternatives are available in the advanced area, such as DNS Zone Editor, which can be used to modify domain settings. You also have access to Cron Jobs; a service used to arrange actions to perform on servers automatically. 

![Advanced features](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-jXMedR-JLCk5ZdYBD_8naDuOQhjwym7TnhLjzfk1FhdsfgeLSqjZb6R83riXHzFsT1hNZQJssYz7oecDSQ__0iB5ucPHBFJgSE3iIGMouNgeBOc8sKwukpAkHOf5JoOm_vYorJI1XhuZWL4BYsiOhg)

Cache Manager is a program that is used to accelerate your website through caching and to boost SEO for your page. GIT and SSL options are also available in the Advanced section. Note: Monitor the automated cache that cleans or purges your webpage every 30 minutes.

### Hostinger Website Builder

Zyro is a website-building tool that provides its own web hosting. It is the product of the established web hosting company Hostinger and enables users to easily construct and deploy simple sites with no effort. 

![Zyro homepage](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/jVKEwTy9id528Hybpp-QsUtZgIAuCJdFvp70nu0Tkz-asbwMKnHBJlZnqL3UyW7NLjMXUZ0D89PrSi7m5LlF4-yKY_U-Ffh3UQsZMJlANBXMGxffEosOsLzoTnlOK_4lI1M5mnep7jCu_LQxc6MYqQw)

Zyro has a huge amount of potential value for those wishing to develop a simple online presence or a simple online store, despite the fact that it lacks powerful functionalities. Zyro is designed for true novices that bring convenience to yet another new level.

Zyro provides a more comprehensive approach to website building. They've streamlined the basic website builder even further and included extra capabilities to assist customers to easily build sophisticated websites.

#### Apps Installer

Hostinger has its own Apps Installer that can be accessed via the hPanel. 

![Apps installer ](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/sKi-HAQoMBzUtuS5iKLgp6XQYbE6-itxmcMDRVVPIrPUaUNd-lAjHWVdqhF6aSL7Ss1zLIFE8TysQAiC9YZ2p5EStvM_0t7-gcTBXNuMdWWP7l4Db8FwFNzpQWxzcoYpnzsmFkj4eBtJYytZfUQ0v6E)

With Hostinger's Auto-Installer, you can effortlessly install software instantly. This tool allows the user to quickly install any of the accessible CMS on their hPanel accounts, such as WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, and plenty of others. To access it, navigate to the Hosting tab and scroll down to the Auto Installer section.

You can use the search box in Auto Installer to browse for a particular application, such as WordPress, or you can select from all the available features on the same tab. Afterward, you need to fill in all the necessary details needed for installation. 

Once you're done filling out the relevant information, click Install, and the installer will take care of the rest! Any databases required by your apps will also be built instantly.

#### WordPress Themes

The idea that the official directory has 8,600+ WordPress themes with general or niche-specific layouts is very noteworthy. 

![WordPress themes](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/vkKzmCadwQjsV8MEnG826EeZIuTeDC0roNZBp_pU1lrNwkb13idkrO119IKS6RZsjSA2q3Jlk6xP6pckRPKDHcvVniEFjTE3OR1S4tOPZd7-JMLqV9-4VS4zn-WiOAaoEwa97M853FOKyQxqUwe3MOM)

WordPress themes serve a wide range of user preferences and requirements. Each comes with a design that can be customized, as well as the ability to change the code, insert widgets, and add plugins. 

WordPress themes are available for every type of website, from eCommerce sites to culinary blogs. If you want generic themes over niche-specific options, they are also provided. And considering WordPress is a free website builder, being able to choose one out of many free themes is also a big plus.

## Hostinger Customer Support

Without testing out [Hostinger's](https://serp.ly/hostinger) support team, no user reviews would be complete. As such, I went ahead and started looking at how to test this web host out. 

![Hostinger customer support section](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TV6NiV6yn7SeQXPu9B88VlPPYIoL6vpVFuN1Oj0nKL_fKs55gQa84j4NrQOGGARdhqtBVduqoCsxOUIPAvEjSiurz-vCfejco9H8ZDQKx279Ghg92uG0tNVzNrkX6sTy7VfUE3LVWfQBR-fqSGciL_A)

When you click the "Let's Chat!" button, you will be directed to a page where you input your name, email, and your questions. After this, I was not redirected to a live chat tab, but instead, I got an email. 

Unfortunately, Hostinger does not offer live chat support for those who are just inquiring prior to purchasing a plan. When you log in to your Hostinger account, you will be able to use the live chat feature, where representatives will assist you in resolving any issues, including technical ones. 

On another note, the support team's reply to my query is very friendly and accommodating; and I only waited for less than 5 minutes to get a response. Not bad! In addition, Hostinger provides a Knowledgebase.

Here, you will be shown different areas of concern. By clicking each tab, you will see various articles and tutorials on how to resolve issues with your Hostinger account. Overall, I believe they have decent customer support, even if they do not offer live chat unless you purchase a hosting plan from them.

Their customer support team reacted in a reasonable timeframe and provided a direct answer to my question.

## Hostinger Pricing and Plans

### Shared Hosting

Shared Hosting plans start at $1.39/month

Like any other web hosting company, Hostinger offers Shared Hosting plans. Your website will be hosted on a server alongside other websites in this most basic hosting tier. The sites practically hold a standard server's expenditures. 

As a result, shared web hosting is frequently considered low-cost web hosting. Yet, because shared hosting is not really robust, your website may decelerate or become inaccessible if there's too much data on your site. Hostinger's services also include two-year and four-year contracts with massive discounts.

### VPS Hosting

VPS Hosting plans start at $3.95/month.

If you're eager about establishing an online presence for your brand, you should start with virtual private server (VPS) hosting. Virtual Private Server hosting, as opposed to shared hosting, provides your website with more server resources to work with as there are fewer websites on the server. Hostinger's VPS plans are somewhat comparable to their Cloud Hosting Accounts, with the primary distinction being back-end management. While Cloud Hosting users benefit from fully managed services, VPS clients will have root access, which significantly increases customization. 

The disadvantage would be that all upgrades and server maintenance must be performed by the operator. The entry-level VPS hosting option is only $3.95/month and is ideal for those who are just getting started. If you feel you've surpassed the features of their entry-level plan, you can switch to a plan that better meets your needs.

### Minecraft Hosting

Minecraft Hosting plans start at $8.95/month.

Hostinger does not provide dedicated hosting but, it does provide Minecraft web hosting for gamers. Minecraft hosting plans begin at $19.95 per month or $10.95 per month with a one-year subscription. 

The most basic plan provides you with a server with 2GB of RAM and 2x virtual CPU power. You can add your own game patches, set rules, and perhaps even permit in-game advertising.

Cloud hosting varies from traditional hosting in such a way that your website is hosted in the cloud rather than on a single server, allowing you greater freedom and scalability. Hostinger Cloud Web Hosting plans are as straightforward to use as their shared hosting solutions, but they include more sophisticated capabilities. 

To build their great Cloud Hosting Plan, it appears that they have blended the best elements of VPS and Shared Hosting. You'll get free daily backups, free SSL forever, incorporated Cloudflare protection, a dedicated IP address, and more. Having their dedicated 24/7 fully managed assistance, you won't need to think concerning the backend at all, as Hostinger will handle everything for you.

#### Reseller Hosting

Reseller Hosting The Starter plan -$35.99 per month with a three-month contract, includes 50 cPanel accounts, 50GB of storage, 500GB of data transfers each month, and free SSL certificates. The Business plan - $33.99 per month with a three-month subscription boosts the features by including 150 cPanel accounts, unlimited storage, and unlimited monthly data transfers.

## Server Speed

Google recommends a load time of 200 milliseconds. This is due to the fact that if your website takes too long to load, customers will lose patience. You won't be complaining about that if you choose Hostinger since it is lightning-quick. Their test site has an average loading time of 150 ms, making it one of the fastest in the market, according to CompareCamp's Hostinger speed test. 

You wouldn't go so far as to call it the Ferrari of web hosting, though it certainly stands on its own. When picking which web host to choose, uptime is an important factor to consider. Hostinger guarantees a 99.99 percent uptime, which is the industry norm. 

Drops do occur from time to time but, Hostinger boasts one of the highest uptime percentages. Hostinger proved to be a dependable web hosting service throughout PCMag's two-week site testing. During the 14-day monitoring period, their test site did not go down once.

### LiteSpeed Cache

This is a popular WordPress plugin that improves website speed and performance. It includes an innovative server-level cache as well as other optimization tools to keep your blog running smoothly.

### HTTP/2

In a nutshell, HTTP/2 is an update to HTTP1, which uses binary code to convey data. The usage of binary coding reduces data size and increases speed, allowing your site to load even faster.

### NGINX caching

This feature improves WordPress performance by increasing the page load speed of static pages. This is accomplished through data optimization. In simpler terms, NGINX caching is a WordPress function that aids in the speed of static content loading on your blog.

## Security and Backups

Based on the package you select, Hostinger provides automated daily or weekly backups. Backing up your data in a timely manner is critical since it can save you from loss of data or file corruption. 

You would not want to jeopardize your data in the event of a malicious attack, a hard drive failure, or an accident. This means that you don't have to start from the beginning and lose all of the hard work you put into constructing it the first time. 

Bitninja is featured with all plans. It is a comprehensive legitimate protection package that guards against XSS, DDoS, malware, script injection, brute force, and other automated threats. SpamAssassin, an email spam filtering app that regularly checks for and eliminates email spam, is also included with each Hostinger web hosting service.
