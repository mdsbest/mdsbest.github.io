## Features of Bandzoogle

The tools provided by Bandzoogle are of the highest caliber. To that end, Bandzoogle has several tools at its disposal to assist you in showcasing and marketing your music. 

[Bandzoogle](https://serp.ly/bandzoogle-hosting), on the other hand, is a website builder that focuses exclusively on music. As an example, you may easily connect to SoundCloud and other social media platforms with a single click. 

Up-and-coming musicians may find it difficult to make a living from their art, but Bandzoogle gives you the tools you need to do it quickly and easily. You may use it to sell your music in a variety of ways, including digital downloads, physical CDs, subscriptions, merchandising, and more. For individuals on a limited budget, this means that all sales are commission-free. 

A Bandzoogle tour calendar may be easily added in two ways. You may either use Bandzoogle's native capabilities to build a custom calendar or connect directly to your Bandsintown account. 

A robust reporting dashboard will be available to all Bandzoogle users, displaying a wide range of important information. From the number of listeners you've had and where they're coming from, to how they found your site and which of your tunes are the most popular, you'll be able to view everything here.

## Interface and Navigation of Bandzoogle

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Z6qepmMA0ZW3BJpKQIsgGUOwzv80jhp0bRdPpaI8wx1PvHUR9REJEr4kSY6dWWND0vg6oQnCRAbF10AMRd7hnNDEn-BLq6pizLlb4oFo7Li2ZC5YZeS2yl5hFfUVfW5v4J4RFViw4KU08SE12AIcFuA)

Confusion and a lack of functionality plagued the website editor. No credit card or payment information is required when you sign up for a free trial. All you have to do now is pick a theme, upload your image, and name your website. The Bandzoogle editor will open when you select the items you wish to include in your initial site. 

It's important to note the level of design freedom offered by this application isn't impressive. Fonts, color schemes, global designs, and element placements are things that you may adjust in your template. Additionally, the interface is simple and lacks many additional features. Although it may be difficult to navigate, you should get the hang of it quickly.

Subscriptions can be purchased in one of three basic forms. If you pay for a year in advance, the lowest premium plan is just $8.29 per month. At a little higher price, customers can also choose to pay monthly. All programs have a free 30-day trial, however, there is no free-for-ever option. 

The lowest yearly package, which costs $9.95 if paid monthly, gives you access to essential features. Up to 100 images, 10 site pages, and 10 tracks may all be added with the Bandzoogle website builder. Additionally, you'll be able to provide music downloads and subscriptions to your customers with no additional expenses. 

A year's subscription to the standard plan, which includes 20 web pages, 50 songs, and 500 images, costs $12.46 per month (or $14.95 if you spend monthly). In addition to music and memberships, you'll be able to offer band items. 

A high-end pro subscription with unlimited songs, images, and pages costs $16.63 monthly when paid annually ($19.95 if paid monthly). Other online selling options include custom typefaces, video headers, and ticket sales. 

An additional custom email account may be purchased for $14.95 per year, and more sophisticated customizable plans are available upon request. As a bonus for music-related charity, [Bandzoogle](https://serp.ly/bandzoogle-hosting) gives out free memberships to all users.

## Pros of Bandzoogle

Before we get into the specifics of the builder's advantages, there's one thing we should mention. Bandzoogle is geared toward musicians and bands of all kinds. No, it doesn't imply that someone who has no connection to music can't benefit from using the constructor for their purposes. 

You may be better off utilizing one of the greatest and most economical website builders of the year instead of Bandzoogle if you want a website builder that is wonderful in general but has zero to do with specialization. You should not, however, let the "musician-exclusive" implication discourage you from giving Bandzoogle a shot. To be honest, this will be a learning experience for me in terms of utilizing a website builder and gaining a feel for the many capabilities it has to offer. 

What if you've always wanted to start your band (or musical brand) but have been put off by the difficulty of getting your name out there? Who knows? This Bandzoogle review will show you how to quickly and easily develop a wonderful band-based website. 

### Ease of Usage

When it comes to website builders, if you've read any past evaluations, you know that we prefer to begin the "pro" sections with a discussion of the "ease of use" component, but only if the builder is genuinely simple to use. However, there's a valid explanation behind this. 

With today's website builders, even someone who has no prior experience in programming or website creation may easily put up their site. A few aspects of this Bandzoogle review aren't unique to Bandzoogle and should be provided by every builder to deliver the service indicated above. 

Ease of use is at the top of the list. This is especially true when it comes to website builders who specialize in a certain market segment. You probably don't have a lot of time to devote to learning how to create a website if you're preoccupied with honing your musicianship and attempting to manage and expand your band (via touring, merch selling, or another method). 

You won't have to when using Bandzoogle. An extremely user-friendly website builder. 

Bandzoogle guides you through the whole site development process. Even though the builder lets you make your selections, he or she keeps you updated throughout the process. 

Templates are straightforward to select, the functions are well-labeled, and adding pages is a breeze, which is a huge deal for many website builders. In general, Bandzoogle has made the site-creation procedure a lot easier thanks to its simple interface. If you've never built a website before, you shouldn't have any issues using the builder.

### Supports eCommerce

You're unlikely to find eCommerce being referred to as a " huge deal" in any of the reviews of top-tier website builders. There are far too many website builders out there that don't have eCommerce capabilities. In many cases, this is because builder companies are still in their infancy and lack the resources to construct long-term eCommerce features. 

Bandzoogle user reviews, on the other hand, will inform you that this constructor has a very different narrative to tell. Customers of Bandzoogle have the option of adding a sales page to their band's website. 

Bandzoogle has a distinct section for each of the primary types of sales, including tickets and events, band merchandise, and more. This may not appear to be a major problem, but I encourage you to give it some serious consideration! In other words: You wouldn't go very far with any other website builder's ticket purchase page unless you were willing to spend a lot of time and effort on it. 

Even if you utilize one of the most powerful page builders available, it may take some time to construct a specific page. When it comes to creating a page using Bandzoogle certain specific features make it even easier. According to user Bandzoogle reviews, Bandzoogle has " done it right" in all of these areas, including discount coupons, sales administration, and delivery logistics.

### Templates

Templates that are optimized for mobile devices account for over two-thirds of all internet time. More than half of the period that a person is surfing the web, they are doing so on a phone, tablet, or another mobile device. 

If you're designing a website, you don't need me to tell you how critical this is. Why is it so important? The same webpage is shown in a variety of ways on different devices. 

Although your website may appear and function properly on a desktop or laptop computer, there is a considerable risk that it will look and function poorly on a mobile device. Because of this, website builders strive to offer responsive, mobile-friendly layouts to their customers. 

In contrast to other website builders, Bandzoogle appears to have nailed this aspect of its business model, according to user feedback. No matter what device anyone uses to view (browse through) Bandzoogle's pages, you can be confident that they will look and feel amazing. All of the company's templates are responsive, and all of the functionality of these templates perform well on a variety of devices.

### Excellent Site Uptime

How prolonged a website is "up" or how frequently people may access it - is referred to as "uptime." Bandzoogle customer evaluations realize that uptime is a crucial issue when it comes to website builders. Only the web hosting company the builder has chosen to work with determines this criterion. As a result, you can expect your website to be accessible for the great majority of that time. 

You'll want to hunt for a new web server if their uptime is less than 99.9%. Websites built with this builder, on average, have an uptime of 99.5% to 99.8%, according to Bandzoogle ratings. That's rather commendable! It's hard to guarantee 100% uptime on a web hosting service because webpages need to be loaded, updated, etc. Despite this, there are superior web hosting services out there.

### Brand For Musicians

While this isn't directly related to the [Bandzoogle](https://serp.ly/bandzoogle-hosting) website builder's features or designs, it's still a major topic worth highlighting. You'll see a row of images of the company's founders and management on the website builder's main page when you open it. Isn't there something about them all that stands out? Yes, all of them are musicians. 

It's one thing to use a website builder supplied by a large company that caters to a broad range of people. When the builder is developed by individuals who have extensive expertise in the specialty, it's an entirely other situation. You may rest confident that all of the tools, design choices and everything else involving the builder has been built by professionals that know exactly what you need and want.

## Cons of Bandzoogle 

In many evaluations, the issue of Bandzoogle cost is expected to be mentioned while discussing the negative aspects of this website builder. It turns out that this isn't the case at all. There is, however, one major drawback to the builder - a lack of security for your website.

### Security

It should come as no surprise that anyone building a website wishes it to be secure. After purchasing one of its plans, Bandzoogle provides users with a free SSL certificate. However, this is the only security feature that this builder offers its customers. 

When it comes to eCommerce, site security should take precedence over other considerations. If you want to sell goods on your website, there is a chance that your customer's personal information will be leaked. There is no way you would want to find yourself in a scenario like that. 

While Bandzoogle customer evaluations don't mention any data breaches or leaks, the builder's lack of security safeguards is still something to be mindful of.

### Price

Check out Bandzoogle's pricing options. Users can choose from three different pricing tiers offered by the business:

- Lite - Monthly payment of $8.29, paid yearly

- Standard - $12.46 a month, paid in full once a year

- Pro - billed yearly at $16.63 a month

The Bandzoogle price plans, as you may have seen, are, to put it mildly, pricey. On top of those pricing plans, you also get a 30-day free trial. That’s a lot of time to use a free website builder! It shows that the business is fairly certain that its builder will not only make a lasting impact but also entice users to renew their membership after the first free trial period has ended. 

The pricey plans are the outcome of the builder's focus on a specific demographic, which is worth remembering when discussing pricing possibilities. Musicians and bands will be unable to take advantage of some specialized features if they select another, more widely acknowledged constructor.

## Conclusion

My honest view is that if you're a musician or a band member looking to "get on the big stage" of the internet, Bandzoogle is an excellent website builder. 

There is a continual stream of praise for Bandzoogle's user-friendly website builder in user reviews. It's possible to develop a website that not only looks great but also serves as a solid foundation for your band with all the numerous features available. 

Overall, [Bandzoogle](https://serp.ly/bandzoogle-hosting) is worth a go if you're interested in making music and want to get your reputation out there. However, if you prefer a more established, well-known website builders, such as Zyro or Squarespace, you can always look out for our list of the top website builders on the market and pay attention to the most highly rated builders.
