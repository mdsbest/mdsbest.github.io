## ABOUT CLOUDWAYS

[Cloudways](https://serp.co/go/cloudways/) is a managed hosting platform that offers excellent hosting services to its customers. It allows the customers to build, deploy, scale, and manage their websites and web applications with ease.

Cloudways is known for cloud hosting, with the option to choose from the top cloud hosting providers. When signing up for a plan, you can select a cloud provider from Digital Ocean, Linode, Vultr, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud.

Cloudways' hosting plans include managed WordPress hosting, managed Magento and WooCommerce hosting, PHP and Laravel hosting, managed Amazon, Google Cloud, Digital Ocean, Linode, and Vultr hosting packages. Prices can go as low as $10 per month for a single site and as high as $1000+ for multiple WordPress sites.

Aside from managed hosting, Cloudways offers free trials, free demos, multiple server locations, an excellent control panel, advanced caching, the Cloudways content delivery network (CDN), a pay-as-you-go payment model, support to many website building tools, vertical scaling to customize your resources according to your needs, easy SSL certificate installation, multiple payment options, excellent customer support, multiple data centers, and many more. A detailed list of all Cloudways features can be seen on the Buyer's Guide portion of this review.

### Getting Started With Cloudways

The first thing I noticed with Cloudways is the number of hosting plans it offers. It has 60+ global network data centers scattered in 15 countries.

After browsing and making necessary comparisons, I decided to try out its managed WordPress plan to create a more comprehensive and detailed review of Cloudways' cloud hosting features.

I chose Digital Ocean as my cloud hosting provider and selected the standard hosting plan, which costs $10 per month. This is also the cheapest plan available on their page. It comes with its own managed platform, 1 GB RAM, one core processor, 25 GB storage, 1 TB bandwidth, a free trial, and all key features of Cloudways' managed cloud hosting (See Buyer's Guide).

One thing I like about Cloudways is the feature where you can start a web hosting plan for free. Most web hosts offer a money-back guarantee, meaning you pay upfront fees and get a refund when you cancel. Not having to pay for the first few days is a thoughtful and generous action from Cloudways.

The first step of the sign-up process is to create a Cloudways account. You can choose to create an account using your LinkedIn, Github, and Google, or you can manually input your name, last name, and email.

I am also asked to describe myself from the following options: Digital Agency, Ecommerce, Other Businesses, Blogger, and Freelance Developer/Designer. For this review, I choose Freelance Developer/Designer.

After clicking the Set-Up button, I was redirected to my Cloudways homepage and greeted with Cloudways' Welcome message.

Next, I opened my email and activated my account. After I input my cellphone number for the phone verification option, I received a message with my Cloudways' verification code and input it on the page to proceed to the verification.

Once my account was fully verified, I was brought to Cloudways' Clients Area.

Real-Time Billing Tab

This tab lets you access your current billing details for the month.
