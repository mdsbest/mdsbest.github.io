## Functionality and User-Friendliness

When it comes to shared hosting, Hostway has just one plan—Website Starter—which includes everything you could want to run a modest to a medium-sized website, unlike many other providers. VPS and cloud hosting options are also available in the event that you need to expand. Shared hosting has the following primary features:

- Crop ready-to-go jobs

- ready for SSH

- Guaranteed uptime of 100%

- SSL support 

- Customizable user interfaces.

- A free website builder

- EasyScripts installation

## Important Information

- Supports: Exchange Server 2016

- Supported Connections: IMAP, POP

- Unlimited Storage: yes

- Maximum Message Size: 50MB

There is no limit to the number of mailboxes you can store with Hostway and a wide range of Exchange capabilities including Microsoft Outlook licenses, additional public directories, resource mails, business disclaimers, and a web-only Exchange add-on. However, these are improvements which must be bought individually and may cost anything from $2 up to $7.50 per product for each user.

### Feature Sets for Work

- Blackberry Support

- Control Panel/ Dashboard

- Email Archiving

- Spam Filtering

- ActiveSync 

- Email Disclaimer

### Feature Sets for Collaboration

- Calendar Sharing

- Shared Contacts

- Resource Mailbox 

- Public Folders

Similar to cPanel and Plesk's famous control panels, this host's SiteControl settings menu provides a user-friendly interface for controlling your website data, FTP accounts and email accounts as well as domains and other features. 

With just a few clicks, you can set up a slew of well-known applications, like WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, and phpBB, using the EasyScripts installer. The only drawback is that the versions installed are earlier versions, but you could still either upgrade them yourself or have the support team do it for you. 

To develop a professional-looking website, you may utilize the Website Builder if you do not want a CMS-backed site and are not familiar with coding. However, despite the fact that you have access to something like a drag-and-drop API, the offered version is somewhat restricted. As a result, you may need to contact the support staff or use WordPress instead.

### Reliability

Features that Ensure Your Safety

- Remote Device Wipe 

- Multi-Tenant Platform Security

- Automatic Backup

- Anti-Virus / Anti-Malware

- Email Encryption

Recognitions

- EU Model Clauses Capable

- EU Safe Harbor Compliant

- SOC Type 2 Certified

- HIPPA

- PCI Compliant 

- FIRMA 

- SSAE 16 Type II Certified

Hostway adheres to strict security requirements to secure their clients' connections between Microsoft Outlook and the Exchanges and provides standard junk and malware screening for every mailbox. In the absence of the Security and Compliance package, extra security features such as sophisticated email protection and Microsoft Outlook backups with storage will be charged separately. 

## Compatibility

Microsoft Apps that are supported by this device

- SharePoint

- Outlook

- Office 

Integrations with 3rd parties

- ShareSync

Hostway offers Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Office Applications integration as well as two Gigabytes of internal memory per ShareSync account. However, extra ShareSync storage choices might cost anything from $4.99 to $14.99, depending on your needs. 

The lack of connection with the other third-party communication technologies like Skype for Business or Salesforce sets Hostway apart from other prominent carriers.

## Costs and Services

Hostway's hosting fees are inexpensive when compared to foreign competition, and you may pay with your main debit/credit card. There are a variety of payment options available for hosting services and VPS plans, including monthly, yearly, biannual, and triennial options, as well as a 30-day money-back guarantee (if anything goes bad, you can escape early). 

The extensive knowledge library and commonly asked questions offer a wide range of subjects for self-support. Customer help is available through phone, ticket, or live chat if those don't address all of your questions. 

### What is the price of Hostway

- There is an additional charge for this option

- Additional Fees for Extra Storage Space

- The monthly fee for each mailbox is $9.95.

- From $8.49 onwards.

- Strengths in Security: Added Charges

[Hostway](https://serp.ly/hostway) is presently offering a limited-time deal of unlimited mailbox space per user with strong email security, directory link (Active Directory Synchronization), ActiveSync Remote Wipe  ActiveSync, 1 accessible folder, retention & wireless rules for each user, and 500 MB of Microsoft  Outlook backup memory for $8.49 a month. 

Security and compliance packages contain the same capabilities, but also five public directories, email DLP and continuity, email preservation, policy-based encryption, compliant cataloging enablement, and 2 Gigabytes of Microsoft Outlook backup storage for $19.99 per month. 

Hostway's plans start at $6.95 and go up to $19.95. Depending on the hosting package you select, the cost will vary. You may find the most recent price table here.

### What is the best Hostway package for me?

Start with a less expensive package, in my opinion. Upgrades are always an option. With the aid of Hostway, you may upgrade to an even more expensive plan. Increasing the number of visitors often takes longer than planned, so don't spend too much money on advertising unless you really need to. Hostway has a team of experts ready to answer any questions you may have about their services.

### Reputation and Support of the Company

### How excellent is the customer service at Hostway?

In our rankings, Hostway does not make the cut. However, it's possible that this is due to Hostway's status as a small, obscure web host. 

If you're looking for a more personalized service, you'll get it from a smaller hosting business. For a more in-depth look at the most popular online hosting providers, see our comparison chart.

### Relocation Assistance

The two-step migration procedure offered by Hostway includes inventory and evaluation of visible data, as well as the construction of a migration strategy. Uptime objectives are reached and transferred apps work in the new environment thanks to the company's aid.

### Distinction

- Trust Pilot Rating: 5.4 out of 10
