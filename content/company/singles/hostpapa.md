The next part of this HostPapa review will walk you through the sign-up process and the website hosting control panel.

## Getting Started with HostPapa

The first thing I noticed when I opened HostPapa's website was how organized it looks. Products and services are arranged neatly by tabs. It is straightforward to navigate, and the pages are all easy to the eye.

Opening the [HostPapa site](https://serp.ly/hostpapa), I was greeted by the promos, services offered, domain name registration box, features, customer support options, customer success stories, hosting awards, and a perfectly organized footer.

But based on what I learned in web hosting, looks can be deceiving, so for the sake of this HostPapa review, I will try one of its web hosting plans.

Among the three choices, I chose the cheapest one, which is the Starter plan. Its initial price is $3.95 and can be renewed at $9.99 per month. Its inclusions are one website, free domain name, free SSL certificate,100GB SSD web space,100 email addresses, unlimited bandwidth, website builder, and many more. 

For a complete list of its features, you can check out the Buyer's Guide for HostPapa below.

After selecting Starter, I was redirected to the Plan Selection page, where I had to choose an initial billing period, server location, and add-ons. I chose annual billing and HostPapa servers located in the US.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/aGKgkWnpOREs8Ccr8RCGBt4lFZlrHTA-r3OYuNXiICgHS1DshzitxPHSW68fxUDwcAmWxfoXA67YKBZRgSroJqQjI7fFkNh2YEwy8TP02o7aB7olfdsHzxsQi0ly-QL0rwkfWeThF-SSZi2DW9Kx8Wg)

Add-ons to choose from are Protection Power Website Security for $19.95 per year, Automated Website Backup for $19.95per year, Paid SSL Certificate for $14.95 per year, and PapaCare+ customer support for $49.95 per month.

For this HostPapa review, I only added Protection Power and Automated Website Backups. My total purchase is $111.30.

The next step is to add a new domain name or transfer an existing one. After checking the availability of my domain name, I was brought to the Account Details and Payment Information page. Payment method includes credit card or PayPal.

Once my payment was validated, a welcome message was sent to my email account containing my client ID and password.
