## Flywheel Walkthrough

![Flywheel hosting home page](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vyZI9LNRGaDkUnwGF5JhsZVzDUOqr7t5em38cSIPXHPJZbbhDvx9sC2ow3qEeIeyTy0SAXKRVKim4woKgAZUBfhVQ-Vwscy2EXsmQ_1xV3HE0we0rWp4xd3FpxYQ8Z6BdKBkTOZs8bwBws5CC23m51o)

The company was founded in 2012 and started as a small managed hosting company but has made quite a name as a WordPress hosting site in just a few years. From the start, they were already thinking of one goal - to help web designers and developers manage their websites. 

It was purchased by another web host called  WP Engine in 2019. WP Engine and Flywheel are now some of the most popular web hosting services available for WordPress users. Aside from speed, security, and performance, they also after 24/7/365 customer and technical support and real help from a real human. 

It is powered by the Google Cloud Platform, which means you are getting quality and tailored WordPress hosting services and the perks that come with using GCP, including but not limited to the powerful insights from Google Analytics.

## Getting Started with Flywheel

To provide a more comprehensive Flywheel review, I created a free Flywheel account and purchased a Flywheel-managed WordPress hosting plan. I signed up for the Tiny plan that costs $15/month and comes with 1 WordPress website, 5000 visits, 5GB storage, and 20 GB bandwidth. I used my Google account to sign up. 

![Account creation screen](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/VT0_DoOwSgT8cPA_E-XQW4HF-vnHVpi4bB_PN-kek2P0AviZloMPCzyHKiDGUuvIXEmQYvcJS8NRR_vzHCMrXxYuv15mYga1ZS91U_Zvr_7MRGNMg9rkmc6j0mcVCs4LY83MIt2BKmEI5dzLH2sF66s)

I was asked to complete my customer profile which includes name, contact number, and occupation. 

![Completing the profile setup](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/XPFbL17cbfB-I3SuZ2vf4h96HQYt9OgSnsQTeUcgdGqC615uJmT46zSVJ_oxQ7sL5c1TGsWcE003VSYkZ2DJrihBOScKNRfX3jNLBAVzwRQag4_7VoGIkUcjwI81faMYsRoNVWtd0gZtdDou9N7nRlI)

Next, I was asked to fill in the subscription details, billing details, and payment method. Here, I also chose my data center location. 

![Subscription details screen](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WjffblgZLL00yrXlxjRx2fWWvW1XFbQTK6WzDeRMc2R5QYTwPHJJfHjO5bVpRYh3GdBL_f3eRnecBHQ-rDyvojVzHm7_Q2tbTayYp43LJll7SK3nXj7n4fSTxYIzmlGgaQnFcSA5LS7WBHQWaUKZMJA)

Once everything was reviewed and ready, I clicked the Checkout button. After my payment was validated and confirmed, I was redirected to the WordPress setup page to create my new WordPress site. I entered my WordPress website name, domain name, and admin username and password for registration. 

![WordPress website info](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5d-J_UHChiWYB9cdrIc4yZ13FTbkLKx26wDKcA-onmEfXFcbVfv5mJtp-C8Nev-ZT4sP5vTkCS6YgKcl6XBbZoO2tCEZf80uavVisxiNczbDsbFbvqHDUySx9pf9W9ZeyM5gdqelxzF9U8VsMrVYXRk)

After, my account was set up immediately. I checked my email address to verify my account and to access my login credentials.  

![Welcome screen](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ManeEl4kRzOuCiuzOs2CvkOXDb2BiihbijFP7PzkIwe4KYtoc1A_be_G5m1eprF67aUNgUrrVJRbztKG_IqfVNGP_C-6jcRUejK7UxQr3qIOMR1Gm7AcPrFsyVbroVGJ_9xPvrVvxlrZvoHpIzNaPa0)

After that, I went back to Flywheel's home page and logged in using my Flywheel account. Up next, I will show you how to manage your WordPress website using Flywheel.

## Using and Managing Your Website with Flywheel

One of the things I liked about the [Flywheel](https://serp.ly/flywheel) managed hosting service is that they offer a free demo site for 14 days. Not every hosting provider offers such, so this is really helpful and thoughtful. 

Using the demo site, you can access and see how the features would work on your actual website. You'll be greeted by this page when you log in. 

![Welcome page following successful login](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/kpa8VAStNlyySZbbo3MworAwtkp0MQdOUMzBK4sHfHAGrO8_MqF4zxo4tnUUVg8c24ic5de4auggN4Bh2WBV7MNekk_b51HpklH8eZ7OxnDzftT2ja7j7Ao-jUDdq4xMbIdUE1OuHn-mlk_-hKUOCac)

In the top section of the page, you can see the different tabs you can use to manage your Flywheel account. The default view is your main dashboard. Here you can see your WordPress sites, create a new WordPress website, and manage or update existing account information. 

The Manage drop-down menu lets your manage your organization, blueprints, group migrations, and referrals. 

![Manage menu](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KtkG5Q8exKInffWF4NZ4yFcmvRr9q4t-cL5ZVP-_O-bDaz36Pr1ckHR8bNAMJQVtKA7KASD1Vz5NnUWynXSNe5kaOS2Bp16isHBWVjL66Xc_b_YR-3vzla5YybNLofeoTbi8wX3CVtKiSAu4HJWEgqc)

The User icon at the upper right of your page will give you a list of drop-down menus, including profile, billing, payment method, security, and product updates. 

![User icon drop down menu](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fbaXWyDOrt1YsX-MPBvAbRpP7maJLI3M0dSL5Na6R6RSKF2-dkA9PNvBDEOWUEamMLXORI995bCV3OCJ68APOEq3zZwBFieVCA9bDXPvmzB5YRSP_tjFU7Fd2dp7NiXmC2w71VYMyYtHgM_CFFL_914)

You can use the Search feature to find the exact site you're looking for. The Sites page shows all the sites you own and the sites you manage as a collaborator. When you click the site name of a WordPress site, you'll be redirected to the individual dashboard for each one.

### Flywheel Hosting Control Panel

The beauty of using Flywheel as a managed WordPress host is that each WordPress site hosted comes with an individual control panel dashboard. 

This makes site management and hosting multiple WordPress websites smooth and easy compared to using other control panels like cPanel. Just choose a website from the main dashboard, and you will be redirected to the page below. 

![Flywheel control panel](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qCtI1gPSE08v_qOdZdTtsZDfRZSg1CG2jrpcbUfgwzoquDHzKxufvZsUmAXutF-YNeiDEshYwqzbKotxyz3TrC6b8cB6-PaJesBwNgVxyK4oFBQPb_BfRvn51Xu4DRoEO9NRpO-ywAmmcmezEKBs38)

Overview Tab This shows your site's domain, DNS status, SSL certificate, and registrar. It's also where you can add a new domain or manage existing ones. On this page, you can also see the Collaborator section. This is where you can add and manage collaborators. 

When adding collaborators, you can use their email address, and they will receive a notification about it. 

![Collaborators screen](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/kSEdXtZFWHCEl9Bjd7VHOfX-RUfEIpAwuD2DUnXeQ5m1dtiWkOQ9PmO_rb74N7XoKQz-YtF5q8RcRhS_8-3xZzf22qngfm7oTlYDr7ooCYpgr14urcDAHRZX1uQcFuHRK_4cJcdW-sEA-2txKcqLsso)

Below the Collaborators, you can see the active SSL certificates. This is where you can add new ones and manage the existing ones. 

![SSL Certificates screen](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/f7V7ik2U442rBIY-FsPylWZAZLq8MPXLcCPko-mLmiDmJA9ZxKQMbFgsNz3QSPAXkn1Z_NOBuRCZGQI1GwNriRsda9E5gIZP4Fo72sUm68CL5tnBcodlKAQzMrJij213czxosPBz4e0g7tvqiXYRuRo)

Another section you can see in the Overview tab is the IP address of each site. 

![IP Address](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/VAjvWgiyDI2-K2x-_0TUf-dDy60tcC81OAyRC_SKn6MeMCXkWjMP7GVva5cKhs5IbEkExoCm5bqiXvvFgEOS8vr73hx8v9Xx5Fe5yxiAZZ6phmmPmecw59q4tXpedCJauJ0pBqBhKPp25DwLIHLrWyY)

Lastly, you can also enable Privacy Mode to prevent others from seeing your current changes to your own sites. When this is activated, the site becomes password protected. 

![Privacy mode](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/xpidkxmzAe02wiC_xBXdv_vA-aFqWVIgcAdSHw_CfxhKQRs38xadsGipgwDGfk_leZ7NLz1tNuqAS5oW4ZF1TpEzTozHtPQZQaRXrkgK01xnJL0A0bHnYbQ7EBFZqiIrrtVF0_eGnsU-LDn9VqAX3hQ)

Plugins Tab This tab displays installed plugins on each of your sites. Here, you can review, access, and manage plugins, and navigate them on your WordPress website. 

![Plugins screen](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3Cvh0yVTTPByYObcWODXVex1zHvqQeYHgDe87VAvOVbRPYJ_AOkKB33Ua6mMVxsGznV_q1RC_ouj7inDDqXBF6qD0IxWfAtZJtxoengCpwORyBrAnfroNVI7rU79Zx1UHpjwihAnVbFOGairTttWAEs)

You can also see the current version of each plugin with a note if it is up to date or not. Unfortunately, WordPress plugins and performance insights are not available for demo sites. Performance Tab This tab displays your website's insights, summary, and web performance metrics. 

Some of the metrics are load time, time to first byte, the number of network requests, caching performance, and more. Also included are personalized recommendations that could help you identify improvements to the site. 

![Performance insights](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_W9ymSMtf7OjZfy4tNS-1EG7dkhpZq3Zu90LNEYFaN-sN8H8j0rHT-C-dxlEDGPfacTmbsMbsPgtlFI_tD_I7ei9VZcdyUg5pql65Z3ZFnBQSZlzu6YsLOmden-ckBw6Zejigrbr69dANK12lBkd59M)

Stats Tab The Stats tab displays graphs about site visits, plan usage, used, and available storage. 

![Stats tab](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ywIJ-s48yFajnBlhwK_ecpTKz0wTGIcUsV5JcYnRaUv5EkXx1uZieOB2AYM-1rJtSJmJmAnISsIttSyUWtnZEeDnpZdNk98o5yG1Opb3loICEkZZ4tr9OaEUZJtnYX-4FMdBwvPdlWhcIz7fqUp7kxo)

Backups Tab Flywheel offers automatic nightly backups that are stored for 30 days. The last 30 backups, and statistics about each backup, are displayed in the Backups tab. You can choose to download or restore the backup files. You can also create a new backup manually. 

![Backups ](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6zKcELwg55vNm5g3etVnWP1nNuFIGTxDwLtG4XtTGFU92HL-8rLo_973MPOKXrS0jcybXAx58Jc6tLa7U5OdU4nwSeCpGIIfH18-6eAwUAEvn1dWtwKHSkuDWhrOE1DYqav7cwL4aWvVafL0VG_l-fA)

Staging Tab Staging site lets you create an exact copy of your site, which you can experiment with without worrying about damaging the live site. You can enable staging using the Advanced tab. 

Once you are satisfied with the changes, you can push them to the live site by clicking the "Move staging changes to live site" button. You have the option to push just the database, just the files, or both. 

![Staging option](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/p7X-14QHoSWZQgZkE_ESeGZgdS1lhRbDBOJvkQOb70Mb1uTbE80n6vYF3btMGJ9xyZ5ikb7NJoUErAIAbqlSINNshEuryu4ZAPHJHc8tx5kk1HfjNqzJvxPcjjZz-jDj1CRXGzOtBGf-6KxDJ-bjCLQ)

Advanced Tab This tab shows the advanced tools for managing your site. Here, you can flush the cache, reset WordPress Login attempts, export logs, enable multisite, set up email, enable staging, development mode, and more. 

Flywheel has its custom database management tool instead of using phpMyAdmin like other web hosts. 

![Advanced options](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lVzPD-vdnwbbxk_vRSjhEmjzDGspDtXsSSH_13EVdJ_U_oYgV522UuVI-ZDsBtNz6FV0eqj1P-Kl2NHuzQuLPYWugKB0_-9cmhGg027RJtIQpSe_yPTl9VezsdWI6W74lIGr9aymBrPDWivqQ9eMW6o)

### Flywheel Hosting Online Website Builder

[Flywheel](https://serp.ly/flywheel) partners with Elementor, a premier drag-and-drop page builder for WordPress. To set up the connection, go to the Elementor page and create an account. Then, choose Flywheel as your hosting provider. 

You can now use your Flywheel hosting account to create a demo website using Elementor.

![Elementor and Flywheel account connection](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/S13RwR-1pss95beyevgNQDd2kmftBO6qXoUCUzRnxKuRe1MIKn_3QpupLnysD0T4av4Q85z76joiFfHUQJziFK62reg1-1RHxfMkriu9F28TMTd5YvyPmwUs-YWAmnjB9lzcT0nwc3RvyeGYmvZlE0M)

After you input your login credentials, site name, WP admin password, and username, your site will be created. 

![Site is being created](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/oUBpIXMEmytqVI0fHrTFX9_swHeMGTJvGMW0QPb_OrWjtgKmUXp1dsiC1pP8W1Rfr36t0bW_pDpSRWewQzoD6EeK82QiMbfaylhpoLoL04cRD3qP8sTO7N9yW5-NJYd2IHD1SOlNdDZeBknYcCXtg4A)

After successfully creating a demo site, you can now access it using WP admin. You can access your WP admin account via the Flywheel hosting dashboard. 

![Site created screen](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6dvJ4kmO-YbCZfFXMERD_X2UUOH-KyWOnXf2qFU0MyWXhpfobbaOg1DyEQnR6gnpwhgbfUd6yzEKEKdUAaBfJhGnwfgyx1qRTnkjBTOeYsftZsEKkGYrPUlKWFmaMO4xN62ZQkVAkoU2NctozGZ2rmY)

You can see the Elementor plugin added to your WP admin account. 

![Elementor in WordPress](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WAD92aKAcwCUKYQquFMXqIVOq2CpmBjTnJxEw0ZPhZ_cos_L-fFMyhPenZWBPYdqvWW0mnBHn_lCRDYuTxa2Ps9fILw9-Oo8_GWKlZlOxzT5slAcMZnDFiGu_f3gNHTeKPqO4dNUbMcH5R041sAX12g)

Creating a new website using the Flywheel hosting + Elementor will provide you with a fully functioning WordPress website. No installation or initial setup is needed. You can go and start building your site with just a few clicks. 

The downside of using Elementor with Flywheel is that the billing between the two is not connected. You can cater your billing separately using two separate accounts. Here are the packages for choosing an Elementor plan. All plans come with a 30-day money-back guarantee. 

![Elementor plans](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/WAZKPl4QIJCCJz35Ypi7P5v2cwQ3IQ9W7-ObXCGt94wmXxEPy1iJmkfZtA1Ft5OpI4GMkV3NE3XOQom3YJSLpLOPjLNnyhLN2YaZ1KmpaUwnr0jeX6JbxrePADlIy33UsFQH-1vgUFX_q0p4eHJOEYA)

To create a website using Elementor from your WP admin, just click the "Edit with Elementor" button. 

![Edit with Elementor button](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CqU39GceBBXGn1cIuVuaaOhCfQLBOUOuj8b7RZIr30VxhExdTPq02PIYXTd2qcNpe7_k7yWOHTqsfgTzmq-qRm3AlDe8nkhC3yTH9xru2WvDzZUhaZjyFhP1pjKM3U-5SI7GizfblA4H3a45pAxpBT0)

This will bring you to the Elementor page editor, where you can start building your site using pre-installed themes from scratch. On the left, you can see the sidebars with all the drag-and-drop features you can use to create a WordPress website. Elementor also comes with lots of pre-installed popular WordPress themes.

### Flywheel Hosting Local Website Builder

![Local website builder home page](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ymTfOWC7986Ckj_pCSr65e_1BQ2M41tLCcxcBQKwNJ0CMRHV3IU2AcRWMbn4F167Udf4zH2uuB5JpAFNr_l9afRnN_0r58FZGpnse4dV5FB01EIAiMKJXjfu2SidxLkjThl8F0qN6ssLMkrzvJ0xd5Y)

Flywheel also uses Local, a free local WordPress development tool. Once you successfully install it, you can create your website offline before hosting it live on your WordPress hosting Flywheel account. 

You can spin up a new WordPress installation easily and develop it using your favorite software. Local development comes with the following:

- Automatic WordPress installations

- Advanced development features - offers root SSH access, WP-CLI, and PHP environments.

- MagicSync - recommends the site files to update and to sync

- Local Connect - Push and pull sites like Flywheel or WP Engine easily

### Flywheel Hosting Customer Support

One thing I often look for in a web host is how they offer support to their customers. As a beginner in web development and hosting, I am pretty sure that I will need assistance from time to time. 

Having an assurance that someone is available to help me makes me feel secure and at ease. Flywheel web hosting offers different mediums for contacting support. You can do it via chat, phone call, email, or demo. 

They also have a comprehensive knowledge base containing articles, ebooks, videos, help docs, and case studies that could help answer some of your queries. 

![Support options](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/X78y82QxwZqZfKDCxhStKXii2PVyIUQ9o56dksdPMCQxEzMRiKfot2m_DmuQ7-RYIbp1eTojk957qAW49ACF3KuLFotYc2R997kc8ZfQ2_j6VUHT4Cs5k9H41P5023YeRh5pw603AbdfqvIZoIyK9Z8)

I tried their chat support and asked about the free demo feature. Unfortunately, the reply wasn't instant. There was no available customer support person who can answer my queries. Instead, I had to schedule a time to chat. 

![Customer support reply](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/BGGwr7u5DAbN51cVIkSn-R2SeRZUSP-_puLAQ4QjA0E9rfCytupcMc_wA3sMAE_i3C-0P2avWEZ2MV2C0RaWBzD3ei-bINBggWzQKqqki7M4YXNgX_FoNTd-Xbnx_-RNT3gs6G8i5YR7TCLt4ZaOMZk)

It took hours before my chat was answered. Although a bit later than most web hosts, they were able to give adequate information to answer my questions. 

![Response from the customer support team](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/gqIjEHzbrQAimwg2wY5JLCoWvyIZ9AS-JPIgkeeLilcfCk5hzoJG1UMnaxB-N2R8ngSpiUMYucnwe2X86poJXhlChFnrJkB5zyVJvCR3bbv3E_37vMoYPem4djFglZjHKvYQcMe2Ay7YI9zSEPFekvo)
