## Pressable Walkthrough

Vid Luther, who founded Pressable in 2010, created a managed WordPress hosting platform that enables website owners to focus on developing and presenting amazing content. The headquarters of Pressable is in San Antonio, Texas, in the United States.

Pressable's objective is to provide a managed hosting option for customers who want to use WordPress but don't want to bother with the security, scalability, and upgrades that come with it or its plugins.

This company currently offers managed web hosting solutions for WordPress sites to start-up companies, medium-sized businesses, and large multinational corporations.

In addition to their many years in the industry, Pressable only hosts WordPress websites, so if you sign up for one of their plans, you'll be dealing with a provider that is highly skilled in supporting and satisfying the demands of WordPress users.

Pressable is one of the first managed WordPress hosting providers, so whether you're seeking a new home for your existing site or want to build a new WordPress website with a high-quality host, read up!

We'll look into Pressable's performance, dependability, and cost in this review.

Let's get started, shall we?

## Getting Started With Pressable

To start, head to the [Pressable](https://serp.ly/pressable) website.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ymY_BqxhHwb-ZeWS9ECwZX6CUhwLYJmvchTWJPp9t9z0pctqs14wcSUXxhXKJDmZGbJIyXZa5DJKftFHRSR_xqlGDwsV070yG0AUy8KrfZYqTQJLSyKvoudCVnEwq_GgB4L8efUBIHryPqQUZjLuQDE)

On the homepage, you will be greeted with a pretty simple page. Here, you will immediately see that they specialize in WordPress Hosting.

Also, there is a small banner on the upper part where you can see if their plans are currently on sale.

Here is an overview of their hosting services:

Managed WordPress Hosting - an optimized WordPress hosting service

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UbJvXN45U8IPBefpqOIh7v2sMscH9eidrNAq1JzDwWkOwbduAaiqgFGlj22LxdbFQ5MzkhpTad62qeDGD3OkCCcZwNY4O8RbD-OSjV3QPC0n7_tg02aiIk3Fg58-kuaLV9W8DuX6xwZyx6dYJBiyB0M)

Managed WooCommerce Hosting - an optimized WooCommerce hosting service

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8F4W-TxfxbAlseXjjKtzKe9vmdo3s3AXZj9JfMGcgBn2s6C0PNRPrITvkCfh9tylStIWmYs0KaRqG7Zkt_8IqCDZqD03LqVF31MrRWVH5vNXiLrC5a17zJF3T63Y486eLBWPiNW9YB0BRiNC89eeSWQ)

For this Pressable review, we’ll explore their most popular hosting plan - Managed WordPress Hosting.

We chose the cheapest option offered, the Personal plan, and we were fortunate enough to get it for a discounted price.

Here, you get one WordPress install, a limit of 30,000 visits a month, and 20GB of storage per month.

After you've browsed and decided on a hosting package, click Let’s Do This.

This will bring you to the checkout page.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/FQJT8DtGW_cFhZWU82P5v6JeABGyzMvZaU4dx1Px8TBa1BRtIFA8EQxKxxCW9FT3EnhjagByqK_bryrkAOt_z6Ulqsk2UYfwoLz7zS2_q8qutyFkfkW3_wZ_CfFqGO21ZUkele7NqsxU8fWdglkphx8)

We love how all the details are on a single page. This way, you can review your purchase without the need of clicking from tab to tab.

Now let’s dive in in detail.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4vBGmrVyf87yp_RzhXYQYh-lK_B08VUarz2JnwlDxXJHKy_9_YFEFvEAhkFjHTBmGxZ15E--LL1-q-ahNjYdTIKZPQtcXPJ-uRIdjZn8cdaE3xmI9N_f1IvnFqkR3zTyvu8UkiIFxeCGt6zfePMoOpg)

The first tab you need to fill up is the Account Information. Here, you need to enter your full name, email address, password, and company name (optional).

Additionally, if you have a coupon code to avail discounts, you can apply that here as well.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/bNRxj01DiGsI7HpqnZ8wkxTH9x40oRnxXr0kW8wHHpuxiyOWuvn6QcOQ--wyaiLnM1eNyyoSwWskE09npawGlsy-iCiKVKpGU_dblbIKBtgKiyHC3AZPjXHtDw7aH-9uybV34HpPLQlcL5f5D3xcm78)

The next step in Pressable’s sign-up process is to fill in the Billing Information. Here, you can only pay via Credit Card so you need to enter the name of the Cardholder, card number, expiration date, security code, and your complete billing address.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/POgQp8TOUsDcScXGUDiOcd_On-u4w7RJkCo2Zuvbq_4UXqFVBK9j0JIhNupjVqrpLkvAWTd9__4X7CLQUHGP8P3cR8-c_c5OnNHEnbB9C6Ey0vHVmzmqNARoZVfs3YsN7d6Q7uHsXDVt28Sq3_FTqm0)

Lastly, this tab is where you can review your order. Here, you can see everything from your chosen plan, your used coupon, the specific plan features, and your total bill.

Once you are done filling in all the necessary information, click Complete Order.

## Using and Managing Your Website on Pressable

Once your order has been confirmed, you may now proceed to the [Login](https://serp.ly/pressable/) page.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/sS8nch0FrbdQ9qmj2qwAuk1q6RAIW-M5SCK0sKWJRPX-fNsSYjt6Mc4ifsdzcXgmXm5IaxxSkKD_dzFL6o6Y4GnN-FFobbzldeakmXKNQ2G9dn5EbiJotp82onvWIp8Y0jRlw-ILAqPiDea-d0M-gcw)

Here, you need to enter the email and password you used to create your account.

In addition, there are alternative ways to access your account dashboard. You can log in through Facebook, LinkedIn, GitHub, Google, and WordPress.com.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1n2Pp6XBJcMbWVBil_kUK7Q-rSCT8nUpcETnNSXw0ljE5S-8mI23vKHGZaEVvGL8kt4QTwzdZ1FtvdXYU6kwONyawxOCIWbXXOB2cIXWLVV6K2b9-u7YiSxDsvaj0WtWAt6yZD8ThODHNA03qXaz8-I)

After successfully logging in, you will be greeted with your Pressable account dashboard.

Accounts, Plan Usage, Billing, API Applications, and API Documentation are all accessible from this page.

You can also visit the Knowledgebase and log out of your account from the lower portion of the navigation menu.

The account area of Pressable is incredibly simple to use. To begin, making a new WordPress website on your account is quite simple: Simply type a name for your new website, and it will be up and running in a matter of seconds.

When it's finished, you can configure some site settings through the Pressable dashboard or go directly to the WordPress admin area through the quick link. You may also begin the process of migrating an existing WordPress website to Pressable from this screen.

They don't provide a domain registration solution, therefore you'll have to arrange your own plans to secure a domain for your site. Nevertheless, doing so is rather easy. Until you are ready to point your domain to the new site, it will be hosted on a Pressable subdomain and held in private development mode until you are ready to go public.

## Pressable Control Panel

### MyPressable Control Panel

The [MyPressable](https://serp.ly/pressable) Control Panel serves as the gateway for all of your WordPress sites. You'll discover information about your websites, as well as access to useful resources and tools for doing routine tasks, in the MyPressable Control Panel. The MyPressable Control Panel is also where you may create a new site or move an existing one from another host.

### Account

The site listing page is the initial view you see after logging into your account. This will show you all of the sites that are currently installed on your account, as well as their IP addresses, the number of domains and collaborators, and whether or not they are staging sites. By clicking on the blue gear button, you can learn more about each site.

### Add a New Site

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/CyVw8MWiyCZJ3LZh-cN6b6hb2PM3d3Xg8qtwyh2_MIMwa6Vch5_Ou-iCBCwzGeer-raD0JkKH3_ke3aL30PFoxZrq5j-D8ngXVMxN0fcRYqYzbH0g11PXv8Z9urkFzWFY1N7NNK5XS0Ppc3_P6XgkFU)

By pressing the plus sign button in the upper right-hand corner of the MyPressable Control Panel, you can add a new site.

From there, simply follow the directions to establish your new Pressable website. Once you do, your website will begin to deploy and an email notification will be issued when it is finished. This email will include instructions for logging into your newly created site.

### Site Control Panel

Upon choosing a preexisting website, you will be directed to the installation's control panel. You can accomplish a variety of things from here.

### Site Information

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/rrG82KAFxco9bNnEPUUh4ozkyWG0xyhO-OcIHcipMcDnPrvfeTXPKFS-IFvaxLR4gvGWFRuPZxfCPI4FuChE7qfgFu6Hu3suvCvYwNjkPgxyQbxaNVy2gN2eOzirOENOiAE_17Pc-EkCrxCsCoMcAzE)

A summary of the website names, visits and storage, PHP version, and data center are all displayed at the top of the page in this section.

Users

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Z8_EgdFNGw3ekqARQu5weVwZLciiN0hXnTAcac0io-7tBeDolp6skSeddqHkKXG2-XfpD-dmjBuo-6j8G1eR3UHXMsqfRPCCbFYVcO4cAJFTDnli4RphovDZdmLKdG95_qiB_OlPHFOD0Iq5oot_8Jk)

You can manage the site's collaborators and SFTP access in the Users area of the MyPressable Control Panel.

### Database

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/PJI31ax0xZbkrohd7gcvtXbfnqCr0_t5t-O-Wv-gABrUgX-8E4s4by0GGIKZlRgSayrAzdFdCn_zekMQd-O4KDUS5Cr992Km3Mh110QQhWRNgkx697znSMw2fvWfadr61x9qp4mW5PXg1pxU1rLtVb8)

Should you need to access the database of your WordPress website, there is a quick link that makes it available via phpMyAdmin, as is the case with many web hosting providers.

The database icon gives you access to your site's database through PHPMyAdmin.

### Migrate Site

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/j1CwvZxc5nwNPbIJ_7SdHupoVQ0Ej9MWCQ6Cv9I5MsIW0gHA6NSYQ08JTywpyOF_-GY9xfmu8eBHartEFIMcXce7QKsmySc3u5lDts9gqJiIEODiFUnIKftXT0YOoCgvzb4G2NcTg02-YQSAwPf0hSw)

The Migrate section comprises your website's migration login information and also a link to install Pressable's migration plugin.

### Clone

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/K6KIcUc5SajCIZkAKPnU-gsYw06NUuiCS4VBvUIN7dvvHrIeTkSsOWisotWvmNYauGhHmQek7nTaAiCV8YucNN-dR8j6H1IazDThwYjUFPLxa3HpIWoTsa67zSrCjK0kssbmx_QlNuyMS-ZygapFl7M)

The Clone tab allows you to make an exact replica of your site for testing or staging needs. There are numerous reasons why you might wish to clone a site, and this is where you could begin.

With Pressable, you can easily make a clone of your site to establish a trial or development environment from which you can securely try out different plugins, themes, and other modifications to your website.

Unfortunately, there is no facility for moving the cloned site back to the live site from where it was produced – or pushing it anywhere else, for that reason.

### WordPress Dashboard

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/cqPixZdN1Ce6LxgggwnNbQejeE5BTOEU4feMZVgs4W8N3364m_zAk-BRZBD-hsrNJAEC2ou_nUDR2_IXJH4awxxs-xtt4Fg00p9Pfy3db0fn5V0qAViof9scJL0DiJ8rUG4-YMq7w0vR2wYKxeXelmg)

With only the Akismet, Classic Editor, and Jetpack plugins installed, Pressable makes no changes to the basic WordPress experience.

There are no changes made to the standard WordPress installation procedure, such as the addition of a website setup wizard or the inclusion of additional third-party themes and plugins.

Since you'll most likely be employing Jetpack to access the capabilities of the Premium plan as a Pressable user, you may also administer your WordPress website through the WordPress.com dashboard.

Some users may want to control their website through the WordPress.com dashboard, particularly if they are transitioning from the hosted WordPress.com service to Pressable hosting.

## Divi by Elegant Themes

### Divi Visual Builder

The Divi Builder is available in two varieties: the traditional "Back-end Builder" and the front-end "Visual Builder." Both interfaces enable you to create the same types of websites using the same content elements and design choices. The UI is the only difference.

The Back-end Builder is housed within the WordPress Dashboard and is accessible with all of the other regular WordPress options. It is integrated into the WordPress UI and takes the place of the normal WordPress post editor. It's useful for making quick adjustments while inside the dashboard, but it's also limited by the dashboard and renders your website as a block-based depiction.

The all-new Visual Builder, on the other hand, allows you to create pages directly on the front end of your website! It's a fantastic experience that enables much faster design. Once you add stuff or modify design settings in the visual builder, your changes are reflected immediately. You can simply click on the page and begin typing.

You can change the font and style of text by highlighting it. You may upload fresh information, construct your page, and watch it all happen right in front of your eyes.

## Pressable Customer Support

Pressable has a committed WordPress support team that could be contacted by phone for pre-sales questions, by email at help@pressable.com, or by creating a support ticket via MyPressable Control Panel, in which you can monitor the status of your ticket.

Pressable does not provide 24/7 help; instead, their support team is available Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. CST. Support is provided for system-wide emergency difficulties outside of business hours and on weekends, although it is not as comprehensive as it is during weekdays.

You can also search Pressble's knowledgebase for getting started videos, FAQs, and other helpful information on the managed hosting plans that are offered at Pressable.

Some customers have complained about Pressable's customer service agents being inadequate and unresponsive, while others have praised them for their helpfulness and knowledge. Because Pressable offers a 15-day free trial, we recommend that you test their customer service firsthand to determine whether you're pleased or not.

## Buyer’s Guide For Pressable

Some hosting companies offering managed WordPress hosting appear to prefer page views or visitor-based pricing, and Pressable is no exception.

Pressable provides programs for individuals, small and medium-sized businesses, as well as enterprise-level plans suited to the client's specific needs. As a result, you can select the plan that best suits your needs in terms of resources and pricing.

You could choose between monthly and annual billing cycles with Pressable. Customers that sign up for an annual contract only pay for 10 months of service, saving them up to 17% off the annual cost of hosting. To be honest, you might need this discount — Pressable's dozens of value-added features, specialized support, and incredibly high dependability also imply that their plans are expensive.

Nonetheless, Pressable's managed WordPress hosting options come with a 15-day risk-free trial. If you're interested in this hosting company but aren't sure if the price is worth it, try out their service to see if they're a suitable fit for you.

### Plans and Pricing

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tYdkMC_HGPSlghwGGLfrYF-EwnPsaK0he24PgcvlEiSpKgNY7uZCZQRS7GxEhN9Sz80WB7hFdDL2OR8Y5Zs9jKm1MEESKO05-sFzEirD1GDgffPHt_1T-7vk3nTTaAvWiM1uaP9AZLf2tFYFyy3GLlU)

High Volume Use costs $750 per month, but it allows your site to manage 5 million page views. You'll also have access to 100 WordPress installations. If these plans do not fit your specific WordPress requirements, contact a Pressable sales representative for a custom build price. Pressable's site hosting isn't cheap, but neither are other enterprise-class WordPress options.

Regardless of the plan you choose, your hosting installation includes unlimited storage, staging environments, free site migrations, enterprise-class architecture, personalized onboarding, site caching, a free Content Delivery Network (CDN), WordPress training, and so many other useful functionalities which you may not encounter with a web host that does not focus in managed WordPress.

Managed WooCommerce Hosting plans start at $22.50/month.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/86VVCY-pJpzfRhkJOooLTP88hRmK5eyo-Q4DKu8kIXLWbXOYZDkoYGNkeTczkrHXdW2YaeZlno9kVIe0matMITt4lQSf1o_ueVAntUPahH-fOJTkJ5KUmTk7AsIHarOfskLLLAjY04wl5YuSigYpODk)

The most popular and widely used WordPress e-commerce plugin is WooCommerce. WooCommerce hosting plans are great for those wishing to build and sustain an e-commerce presence. The best option for you is determined by the amount of money your business makes each year.

You can pick between four different WooCommerce Plans. They differ in the following ways: storage allocation, The highest number of monthly visits supported, the maximum amount of websites you can create with a single account, customer service level. backup, caching, and optimization capabilities.

Furthermore, all plans include an SSL certificate, which is nearly required for those selling on the web.

### Server Speed and Uptime

The uptime of a website is a critical component of the web hosting experience. Clients or consumers will be unable to find you or access your products and services if your website goes down.

According to PCMag's performance and uptime tests, Pressable is extremely stable. They said it was one of just a few that went down zero times. As a result, you can rely on Pressable to provide a strong foundation for your site.

Furthermore, the company promises that they upgrade servers on a regular basis to meet such requirements.

Pressable will provide you with excellent server response time right out of the box. How well you optimize your site will determine whether or not you can profit from it.

### Security and Backups

To keep your website safe from attackers, Pressable employs a combination of nightly malware scans and deletions as well as Intrusion Detection System integrity checks. This is a feature that is common among managed WordPress hosting services.

Furthermore, each Pressable plan includes a free Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate, which helps protect data transfers between your website and customers. Given that some web providers charge for SSL, the free inclusion of the certificate is a welcome addition.

This host's packages all include a membership to the Jetpack Premium plan. Not only does this provide you access to some very valuable capabilities, but signing up for Jetpack Professional could charge you $99 per year.

The Jetpack Premium subscription is an excellent addition to practically any WordPress website, assisting in the safe, secure, and smooth operation of your site.

## Final Thoughts

Pressable's managed WordPress hosting solutions may be an excellent fit for website owners who need to host a large number of WordPress sites but don't want to be constrained by their maintenance and monitoring, and are willing to pay a premium for this convenience.

Despite the fact that Pressable was created by the same folks who created WordPress.com, Jetpack, and WooCommerce, and despite the fact that this hosting service offers NVMe server hardware, it is not the best-managed WordPress hosting provider. There are, in fact, better-managed WordPress hosting alternatives.

On the brighter side, [Pressable](https://serp.ly/pressable) offers greater freedom than other web hosting providers who offer Managed WordPress hosting, making it an outstanding web host for small businesses.

I hope this Pressable review was helpful in your search for a web hosting company!
