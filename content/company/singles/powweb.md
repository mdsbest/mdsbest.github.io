## PowWeb Review

[PowWeb](https://serp.ly/powweb/) is a web hosting company owned by Endurance International Group, one of the world's top web hosting companies. Despite being owned by EIG, PowWeb operates mainly independently.

## Getting Started With PowWeb

When you initially try to sign up for the hosting service, you are presented with only one option. Under its "One Plan, One Price" Perfect Hosting Solution, you'll have access to unlimited disk space, scalable data transfer, and PowWeb's proprietary "Load-Balanced Hosting" solution.

This solution distributes the load of a single website across multiple physical servers to prevent effects on end-users or downtime should a dedicated server go down.

There are also a host of other great offers for the Perfect Hosting Plan offered by PowWeb. For this review, we'll go with PowWeb's only hosting plan. You can either register for a domain or transfer an existing one. You are given a free domain name for a year.

On the next page, you'll have to enter your biodata. Input your first name, last name, email, nation, state/region, zip code, city, address, and phone number on the contact information page. Next, you'll need to enter your payment information, which may be done with a credit card or through a PayPal account. Then you may choose the time frame for which you'll be making the initial purchase.

You will also be offered extra paid services such as domain privacy + protection, WordPress Optimization, Website Builder, Sitelock Website Security, Google Workspace, and Site Backup. While attempting to pay for my web hosting, my payment was rejected – twice.

My transactions were marked as 'high-risk', so they requested a photocopy of my government-issued ID to be sent to Powweb’s compliance team to complete my purchase. With these, you are set to get started.

PowWeb will send your payment confirmation and login credentials to the email address you used when registering. You will also receive an email with all the details, including the login information and the control panel URL. You will be able to change your account password using the link they will provide you. You may get a mail requiring you to validate your domain.  

## Using and Managing Your Website on PowWeb

When you first log into the PowWeb website, you are greeted by a screen prompting you to answer a few questions. After answering the questions or dismissing the pop-up, you'll see a summary screen that displays information about your domain and common actions.

You'll have access to your dashboard, site builders, account settings, billing email management, website security, DNS & Nameservers, and help. On the domain tab, you'll have access to manage all your domain and launch your webmail.

You can also purchase and import domains. You'll have access to info about your plan, server information, and dedicated hosting tools on the hosting tab. I especially like the unlimited storage, bandwidth, hosted domains, subdomains, and FTP logins on the PowWeb One Plan.

You'll have access to free tools like Google My Business and a logo maker in the Business Tab. What screen are you shown the very first time you log in to the website? What do you have access to?

## PowWeb CPanel

PowWeb uses its own control panel instead of cPanel. However, the custom control panel available at PowWeb is similar in functionality to Cpanel and allows you to, among other things:

- Use a WebsiteBuilder and a WordPress one-click installer

- Create and manage databases and DB users

- Back up your website files

- Create FTP users and email addresses

- View website statistics

- Manage and add domains

- Monitor disk usage and view server information

- Schedule cron jobs

- Edit your server’s .htaccess file

In the email you received, you'll see the link to the control panel. Alternately, you can easily access the control panel from your domain by clicking on the block icon near your name in the upper-right corner.

Once you enter, you will be greeted by this screen. Here, you have quite a few tools. While they may appear bewildering, after we go through them all together, you should fit in quite nicely with PowWeb's web hosting services.

### Web Cache Control Tool

Caching can make your site load incredibly fast by letting your visitors load unchanged content out of their browser and letting their servers serve your content very quickly. You can use this Cache-Control Tool to turn the caching of files off or on and select how long you want to cache different file types.

### Change Catch-All

### Mojo Marketplace

Select "one-click install" on the Mojo Marketplace to set up WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, OpenCart, Magento, Prestashop, and more. You can find other available software and programs on PowWeb's shared web hosting platform here.

### WordPress Themes

You can install WordPress directly through your domain dashboard as well. Select WordPress on your summary page to get started. On the next page, you'll see an advertisement card.

On the next page, you'll be prompted to either use your existing hosting plan or choose an optimized hosting plan for WordPress. Here, we went with the existing plan option, after which the wizard prompted us to add a Site Title. Thereafter, you will create an admin account for WordPress, after which you'll have access to free themes.

Alternatively, you could use PowWeb's AI-powered website builder. Select a plan which fits your need. We went with the starter plan, after which our website was set up automatically. You can answer the questions to have a website built for you. The stock website looks like this.  

## PowWeb Customer Support

[PowWeb](https://serp.ly/powweb) boasts about their excellent customer service and support staff, so I decided to close my account and see how quickly they would respond. I opened the chat support, entered my name and email address, and answered the questions. I was politely asked why I wanted to cancel, and after I explained, the customer support team representative canceled it.

However, because I used up my domain credit when registering, a $15 non-refundable fee applies. The customer support representative mentioned that it might take 7-10 days before I receive the refund. To my surprise, I was refunded the same day!

## Buyer’s Guide For PowWeb

### Plans and Pricing

PowWeb's use of a "one plan-one price" model simplifies decision-making. Its only shared hosting plan is competitively priced at $3.88 per month if you pay for 3 years.

However, it will cost you $11.95 to auto-renew, which is close to the industry average. There is no monthly billing either; all payments are processed yearly. PowWeb's hosting plan also includes a 30-day money-back guarantee.

If you open a new hosting account, register a new domain with PowWeb, and use up your "domain credit," you will be charged a $15 non-refundable domain additional fee. PowWeb, like most hosting companies, does a lot of upselling after you pay for hosting.

You can purchase PowWeb's product with a credit card or through PayPal. Check out [PowWeb's](https://serp.ly/powweb) current deal for the "one-plan one-price" hosting plan here.

### Server Speed

PowWeb's infrastructure is high-speed and flexible. Because PowWeb uses load balancing technology, its servers are provisioned quickly (in under a minute) and feature scalable bandwidth.

The result is faster page loading times that are more stable than traditional shared hosting providers. The usage of cloud hosting also speeds up the entire process.

### Security and Backups

PowWeb uses its own software updated regularly to add new features, fix bugs, and protect against security holes. If a problem arises with the software powering your website, PowWeb's service tech support is very responsive and will make sure that you are up and running again.

PowWeb's hosting plan includes daily backups for all files, databases, e-mails, and an unlimited number of websites.

However, unless you purchase PowWeb's backup software service, they should be stored on your own hard drive in a zip file, not encrypted format. This means that you will be responsible for restoring them if you ever need to. An uptime guarantee is to be expected with such strong levels of backup and protection.

### Customer Service and Technical Support

If you run into any technical issue with your hosting, PowWeb has highly trained experts ready to walk you through the process so that you can resolve it quickly. They are available 24/7 by phone, live chat support, or e-mail.

At the time of this writing, they answered my inquiry within a few minutes. E-mails generated by PowWeb's hosting plan (e.g., account confirmations) contain links to "how-to" articles that explain how to use the services provided by the company. They are also categorized into separate files for easy reference.

### Ease of use

Instead of providing its clients with various hosting plans to select from, PowWeb recommends a single package that will satisfy all of your needs.

This package provides several appealing features to reach that objective, including free domain registration upon enrollment, unlimited disk space and expandable bandwidth, a user-friendly and charge-free website builder, and a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you want to examine all of the information, choose the “See all features” option right below the highlighted ones.

All of the offered features are presented plainly. However, instead of utilizing the industry-standard cPanel (or Plesk for Windows users), PowWeb offers a proprietary control panel, which is neither the most user-friendly nor the most feature-rich option available.

From there, you can install WordPress and other popular software via Mojo Marketplace, which works well but not as quickly as Softaculous. In addition, a drag-and-drop user-friendly website builder is available, which will help you get your website up and operating as quickly as possible.

### Features of PowWeb

The following features are included with the "one plan" hosting plan:

- There is no restriction to disk space, data transfer, or bandwidth.

- Unlimited domains

- DNS management

- Unlimited FTP users

- Personalized error pages

- Backups are performed daily, and access to restore is available with a single click.

- Script Installer - for installing WordPress, phpBB, osCommerce, Gallery 2, and other applications

- Supports PHP4, PHP5, Perl5, Sendmail, and Zend Optimizer are all available

- Flash, Shockwave, MIDI, and multimedia files are all supported

- Credits for search engine advertising

- MySQL and phpMyAdmin, as well as Webalizer and AWStats

- Email accounts with an unlimited number of recipients

- Shopping cart and shared SSL certificate

### Pros

- Reasonable first-term prices for new users

- Fast and responsive live chat help

- Generous email sending limits

- Credits for a free domain

- Exceptional uptime for hosting

- Custom DNS and cron tasks are excellent features.

### Cons

- Single hosting plans.

- Only credit card payments are eligible for the 30-day money-back guarantee

- Infrequently updated blog

- Almost dead social media presence

- Out-dated user interface

- Limited and clumsy control panel

- No monthly terms or company offers offered to new customers

- Uber-expensive renewals

- Occasional issues with the website's load speed

- Restoration of a website backup is at a premium

## Final Thoughts

[PowWeb](https://serp.ly/powweb) provides new users with an affordable and attractive option. However, to take advantage of its best qualities, you must stay committed for two years. Even worse, the renewal fees are much higher than the industry standards. Additionally, PowWeb reviews aren't good. Other web hosting providers seem to be doing a better job, especially for medium-sized businesses.

Setting up a website on PowWeb was also quite effortless with their website builder, and the customer service was quite responsive. However, PowWeb charging a non-refundable $15 for domain credit came as a shock. On their homepage, PowWeb stated the domain names to be free. 

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7KjnnsrJtf0R_TbddxD-bqXDLKJGLaDBLX1S_ykBTsj15otYvzyKJoLCJ1wI7FB_QAWuF69VoN3_u0bWQ3Khdc0KOBT4ES24kNI-0vKN3pBkn0CZckcufa1aY4i8ZxKoKbSiKQqWDdVlk9kiprLjass)

However, On their 30-day guaranteed return page, it was implied that there would be no charge if they chose not to hold on to the domain. PowWeb misrepresented that.  

Regardless, Powweb is a good choice if you intend to start your first website or want to host dozens of simple low-traffic blogs and don't mind the occasional downtime that comes with hosting on a shared server with unmetered resources. Overall, I would recommend that you try it out if possible before committing long term. This would conclude our PowWeb review.
