## Enterprise Cloud Solutions from INAP

### Private Cloud

All of the perks of the cloud, tailored to your requests. Flexibility, safety, and scalability: There are numerous reasons to select a private cloud service. And, with [INAP](https://serp.ly/inap-cloud-solutions), it's simpler than ever to configure and install the perfect option for your business and applications. Private clouds are great for firms that must comply with HIPAA or PCI.

### Managed AWS 

Navigating this maze-like platform economically and successfully needs both specialized knowledge and a significant amount of time — resources that many IT departments do not have. With INAP Managed AWS, professional engineers and architects help you protect, maintain, and optimize public cloud settings, so your team can focus on the apps that run there.

### Managed Azure 

The increasingly widespread Microsoft Azure platform provides an efficient IaaS option to conventional IT infrastructure settings for specific workloads, use cases, and applications. 

However, getting started and running these accessible cloud instances is not always as simple as it appears. Microsoft-certified engineers help you secure, maintain, and optimize your public cloud setting with INAP Managed Azure, so your team can focus on the applications that are stored there. This way, your team can focus more on the applications.

### Cloud Backup

Backing up confidential information on-premises is a smart idea, but it isn't enough in today's threat scenario. Only remote cloud backups offer the best data redundancy and protection. 

INAP Cloud Backup, which is enabled by Veeam Cloud Connect, is a simple, economical, and secure approach to ensure data protection. With our risk-free trial, you can back up to something like enterprise-grade cloud storage in just a few minutes.

### Disaster Recovery as a Service

Business continuity is more than just a buzzword. It is about ensuring that your applications function properly for the individuals that rely on them. It's about exceeding the standards you've worked so hard to establish. It's all about shielding your image from the unavoidable. 

But you do not need us to inform you what disruption appears to mean for your company. You won't even have to explain it to your consumers if you use INAP Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS). INAP strives to be your worldwide collaborator for cloud computing infrastructure and bare metal servers, such as Managed Azure Cloud and Managed AWS Cloud solutions. 

## Support 

INAP's goods and services are not inexpensive, as you might expect from managed cloud hosting, but you do get what you paid for. You can also pay monthly or annually. Signing into your account as an old customer will allow you to access INAP help. Alternatively, you can communicate with the assistance chatbot as a pre-sales potential customer:

They have an excellent technical support staff They say that they have a "rock strong" customer service that routinely ranks them 17 percent higher than other hosting companies, and they are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week through the use of live chat or ticketing system. They also provide a phone number for customer service as well as billing and sales inquiries.

## User Comments on INAP

“Since 1996, they have provided excellent hosting.

[Internap](https://serp.ly/inap-cloud-solutions) already has a goal since 1996, and that is to enable the internet to perform at its highest point, and through browsing their website, it is clear that they attempt to push that limit. They have a strong hybrid infrastructure that is adaptable, expandable, and easily accessible. 

They have a lot of different data centers all over the world so that they can keep their reach as wide as possible and give their customers the best service in terms of dependability, efficiency, and flexibility. In the United States, data centers can be found in Boston, Atlanta, Houston, and Dallas, to mention a few cities. 

Servers are located in Amsterdam and London in Europe, and in Singapore and Hong Kong in Asia. In addition to network services, dedicated servers, and managed services, Internap also provides a variety of cloud hosting alternatives. 

Many of their services are aimed at big businesses, such as advertising, e-commerce, technology, financial services, online gaming, healthcare technology, and online education, but they also help small businesses.

One hundred percent uptime is guaranteed

This company is so sure of its technology that it has a service level agreement that promises that everything will work at all times. They credit your account for missed time the instant their activity clock begins ticking.” 

\- Michael Levanduski 

“What I enjoy about this is the customer service. They are not available every time, but they are also very friendly and eager to solve any problems that arise. The adaptability with which solutions are provided adds to the excellent aspects of the outstanding support service. 

The likelihood of a service blackout is low, so the service is accessible most of the time. The customization option is significant since it lets people customize items to meet their personal needs. The servers are fairly responsive and allow for simple data administration. 

The pricing is reasonable for the satisfaction you receive, and the treatments are well worth the money. Shield Plus significantly eliminates any form of cyber attack, making this one of the most secure cloud services available. The availability of service by phone is a significant advantage that sets it apart from its competitors. 

However, the downside of this is that the support crew is not large enough, which might be a burden at times due to a shortage of hands-on personnel available for help. Because a lack of statistics increases the likelihood of thoughtless blunders, several businesses are apprehensive because they cannot afford to risk much. 

There are instances when abuse accusations are not addressed properly, which can make the situation frustrating. The lack of an email alternative is also a problem. Globally, the available locations are limited, and migration does not have a big range as well. 

The INAP Cloud is a fantastic service agent with a slightly higher price than its rivals in the industry, which can be an issue, but the premium quality they deliver is worth the amount of money that you pay for.” 

\- Trookie Mäklare P 

“The thing that I like and appreciate about this is how quickly I can get a human specialist on the phone when I need help. And, regardless of the fact that they do not charge for any form of service upgrade, my service tickets (particularly downtime reports) are taken up and answered within minutes. 

The reaction time is unrivaled, and I presume this standard of service is far superior to that of a multibillion-dollar megacorp hosting provider. INAP appears to be a lot more personable and sincere in its assistance. 

I called in several times and requested assistance accessing my website that I had unintentionally shut myself out of, and they had a specialist connected with a KVM to figure me out in no time. 

Their gear is really fast, and their network is extremely stable. Since 2014, I believe there's been one brief outage. I intended to write this evaluation to let other sysadmins know that, while this isn't the greatest or most common hosting service, it is absolutely worth checking out because I haven't had any of the horror stories I've heard about with other providers.” - Kevin Richard
