With the Spark plan, you get to host 1 WordPress website, have 15GB of storage, 2TB of bandwidth, a free staging environment, 30 days of backups, unlimited email accounts, and a 30-day money-back guarantee.

After you've browsed and decided on a hosting package, click Get Started.

This will bring you to your Nexcess portal.

Here, the first thing you can do is to set up your preferred billing cycle as well as your account.

On the left side, you can also view your cart, and if you have a coupon code, you can also type that in the provided box.

Once done, click Sign Up.

After you've successfully logged in, you now have access to your account dashboard.

The portal's primary page is titled "Home." This page provides a brief overview of account-specific information.

Nexcess, as you can see, does not use cPanel, but all of the features you'll need are accessible here. To administer your account, billing, and so on, the company has its own hosting control panel.

## Nexcess Control Panel

If you select a managed WordPress hosting plan, you can only use the proprietary control panel, which has an easy-to-use design and allows you to manage many WordPress sites from a single location.

This is a simple dashboard that gives you access to all of the tools you need to operate your site. Here are a few examples of what you can do with the control panel:

- Configure free SSL certificates

- Monitor bandwidth use

- Enable the Nginx Accelerator to speed up content delivery and purge its cache

- Set up staging and development environment

- Manage your email accounts

- Turn on the free CDN services you get with your hosting plan

- Create manual backups

- Set up an FTP account for testing purposes

### Overview

The Overview page would be the first page you have when you enter the portal. This page provides a brief overview of account-specific information.

#### Call-In Pin

When contacting the Support, Billing, or Sales teams for assistance, you'll need the call-in PIN.

#### Support

This only applies to open support tickets on your account and excludes closed tickets.

#### Invoices

This indicates the balance owed on your account:

Green Dollar Amount - There is no balance owed, and all invoices have been paid. Your account is up to date.

Orange Dollar Amount - The amount is due shortly, but it is not past due. Your account is up to date.

Amount in Red - The amount in red is past due. The Total Amount Due displayed represents the sum of all open bills on your account, both paid and unpaid.

Choosing a payment option does not enable automatic payment on your account. Contact the billing department to confirm your automatic payment status.

Although PayPal subscriptions are not currently available, Nexcess accepts manual PayPal payments.

#### Addresses

This is the address that appears on your invoices. More information about your addresses can be found in the Address area of the Corner Drop-Down Menu.

#### Announcements

The latest system update can be seen here. To get a record of all system notifications on your account, click View All.

### Plans

This menu item will bring you to your cloud hosting plans, which include managed WordPress, WooCommerce, and Magento services.

The number within the parentheses beside the name represents the number of implementations of that service on your account.

### Shared Hosting

This tab will direct you to your non-cloud packages, such as shared or dedicated servers.

### SSL

An SSL certificate protects confidential information on your website. If a tiny lock displays next to the site address in your browser, the site is secure.

### Billing

#### Credits

Every credit on your account has a Description, a Date when it was added, an Amount, and a Status. A credit is classified as either Applied or Unapplied.

Applied - The credit has been used in its entirety. There is no credit remaining.

Unapplied - The credit has not been applied or has been applied just partially. The quantity of available credit is shown in the Remaining column.

To view the bills paid with the credit, click the credit description.

#### Credit Cards

A credit card could be employed on more than one account.

On the due date of an invoice, only the chosen Primary credit card is automatically charged. Additional cards can be used for manual payments, but they will never be charged automatically.

After three declines, the system will stop attempting to auto-charge.

#### Payments

Payment information is organized chronologically by date. Each payment can be sorted according to the Invoice ID, Date, Type, or Reference Number.

### DNS

DNS is an abbreviation for Domain Name System, and it functions as a sort of "phone book" for the Internet. DNS translates online addresses, or URLs, into a physical IP address that corresponds to the computer that hosts the site. Specific tools and services necessitate that users edit their DNS settings, and these same tools and services frequently necessitate that users change a particular type of DNS record.

## Nexcess StoreBuilder

Nexcess, a managed WordPress and WooCommerce hosting provider, features a StoreBuilder for creating an online store or shopping site.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/cO-4eGKhqcl3RnoQE4d-4mjQcJkf_tNTB_ze_sUJeFDa2k5q7IgbH7UBZV2efNY_lxngDENLyzN_KQYZrBVOvRacjwLdXuLeYMQAGmCPq7QtygkcnXT5xDtLiBwz7q_ZyuDUtCcEg9szczbJXo5__F8)

StoreBuilder is an artificial assistant that helps WooCommerce stores in getting up and running quicker than any other service in the industry. Instead of selecting a theme that looks the same as everyone else's, StoreBuilder employs artificial intelligence to generate a unique homepage.

Nexcess' e-commerce experts examined over a thousand stores built in the last ten years in ten different industries, including clothes, jewelry, home products, and electronics. They classified the most profitable stores based on product quantities, menu items, website pages, and homepage content.

Their ideas were turned into an intelligence engine that makes sound decisions regarding pages, menu items, what goes on the homepage, and the order in which pieces should appear. The engine gets a small amount of information from you and then generates a personalized web store equipped with content.

If purchased separately, StoreBuilder costs $19 per month. However, if you purchase [Nexcess](https://serp.ly/nexcess) managed WooCommerce hosting, it is included for free. Most importantly, it is more compatible with WooCommerce hosting. This product will renew at the regular rate of $19 per month. Renewals do not have a price increase.

StoreBuilder, on the other hand, does not have a storage space or bandwidth limit. In the catalog, you may add an endless number of products. It is a stand-alone item. However, if you buy it on its own, you will not receive any email accounts. When used with a WooCommerce hosting plan, it provides several email accounts.

Nexcess StoreBuilder is an excellent substitute for Wix and Shopify. You receive 50,000+ plugins for tailoring every aspect of your website or store.

There is no limit to the number of products you may add to your catalog. To integrate and collect payments, hundreds of payment gateways are accessible. There is a self-help resource center, and specialists are available 24/7 via live chat or email support.

If you already have a WooCommerce store, they will migrate it as part of the package price. This means that website transfer is completely free.

Nexcess Installer Plugin

Nexcess Managed WordPress and Managed WooCommerce websites include a variety of plugin configurations. This includes Astra Pro, Beaver Builder, and several premium plugins for managed WordPress and WooCommerce plans.

The Nexcess Installer plugin simplifies the installation and management of plugins that are included in your Managed WordPress or Managed WooCommerce services.

## Nexcess Customer Support

Nexcess ensures excellent service since it is backed by The Most Helpful Humans In Hosting. Within the first year, the support team undergoes over 300 hours of training, so you can trust that any agent you speak with knows what they're doing.

Even better, they're available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, so you never have to wait for assistance. You can contact the Nexcess support team through Live Chat, Support Ticket, or Phone.

In our case, we opted for live chat support to get a quick response to our questions. Simply click the live chat widget in the lower right corner of the homepage to be connected to a customer service representative in a matter of seconds.

Here's how it went:

Our chat with Meghan went well. She was very helpful and knowledgeable throughout the conversation, and that is what exactly we're looking for whenever we test a hosting provider's customer support.

Furthermore, if you require technical support but do not wish to speak with a person, Nexcess features a knowledge base that includes support articles, a blog, and documentation.

In their documentation, you may find solutions to the most typical concerns and difficulties, which is a plus in our opinion.

Many hosts can provide PHP code and MySQL database hosting. What distinguishes Nexcess is the additional capabilities they provide, such as staging sites, dedicated IP addresses, auto-scaling PHP workers, and PCI-compliant hosting.

Magento Cloud employs virtualization to generate your Magento server "in the cloud," albeit you can select which data center your virtual server is located in.

Cloud Hosting plans start at $49.00/month.

One of the primary reasons Nexcess can deliver such outstanding speed as compared to other web hosting companies is their sophisticated cloud-based hosting infrastructure.

Websites and other applications are typically hosted on a single physical on-premises server.

A web application or a website, on the other hand, is hosted on a system of interconnected virtual and physical cloud servers in Cloud Hosting rather than on a single server.

Hardware failures cannot cause downtime since websites or applications are stored on a network of interconnected servers.

Furthermore, cloud hosting is scalable, and cloud hosting resources may be quickly supplied on-demand or made redundant as needed.

As a result, most cloud hosting providers, like [Nexcess](https://serp.ly/nexcess/), only charge consumers on an hourly or monthly basis for the resources that they utilize.

Nexcess offers cloud hosting alternatives for all of its web hosting services, which are charged on a monthly basis.

### Server Speed and Uptime

No web hosting review would be complete without examining and analyzing the speed and performance of the web hosting services offered by the web hosting company under consideration. This Nexcess review will be no exception.

Nexcess is among the few web hosting companies that guarantee 100 percent uptime. Of course, it's unrealistic to believe that this will indeed happen.

Nexcess maintains an outstanding and above-industry-standard uptime. According to WPKube, its network uptime in 2019 was 99.9992 percent.

When your site does actually go down, Nexcess gives a ten-fold reimbursement for the amount of downtime to all affected hosting customers. For example, if your website is unavailable for one hour, you will earn a ten-hour hosting credit to your account.

Nexcess delivers more than just guarantee fast loading speeds when it comes to loading times. Indeed, it includes sophisticated capabilities that enable your website to function at optimal rates and perform well.

Nexcess owns and maintains three core data centers privately, all of which have excellent speeds.

The average speed in the US-Central region was 402ms.

The average speed in the US-West region was 453ms.

Lastly, the average speed on EU-Central was 765ms.

We'd say that's pretty fast!

### Security and Backups

All [Nexcess](https://serp.ly/nexcess) plans include premium plugins, such as iThemes security pro. So there's no need to be concerned about WordPress site security. It miraculously resolves all website issues, weaknesses, and viruses.

With a single click, you can enable local brute force protection, two-factor authentication, and a rapid site scan. A free SSL certificate for encryption is also included by default.

#### PCI-Compliant

By following a specific set of criteria, PCI Compliance ensures that your eCommerce store or website can securely take card payments.

Nexcess offers PCI DSS Level 1 hosting services throughout the board.

This implies that Nexcess adheres to all of the PCI Security Criteria Council's mandated security standards for its web hosting infrastructure.

As a result, if your site or online store is hosted on any Nexcess plan, your consumers can be confident that their payment information is safely kept and processed.

#### SSL Certificates

SSL Certificates are files that allow a secure connection to be established between a web server and a user browser.

Having SSL certificates on your web server allows sensitive documents such as payment information, personal identification numbers, and login passwords, among other things, to be safely communicated between the user client and the host server.

If your website is protected by an SSL certificate, it will be reachable via the secure HTTPS protocol, and a green padlock will be displayed in the browser.

When visitors access websites that are not secured with SSL, most modern browsers present negative warnings.

Users are also warned from providing personal information and financial information to websites that are not SSL-secured.

Fortunately, Let's Encrypt SSL certificates are activated by default on all Nexcess hosting packages, including Nexcess Managed WordPress and Nexcess Managed WooCommerce.

#### iThemes Security Pro

All Nexcess Managed WordPress or Nexcess Managed WooCommerce package includes free access to the premium iThemes Security Pro plugin.

With the aid of this plugin, your site and enterprise can benefit from its superior security capabilities, some of which are listed below:

- WordPress Brute Force Protection

- Local brute force protection

- Network brute force protection

- XML-RPC brute force protection

- Database Backups

- Google reCAPTCHA Integration

Backups

Many hosts do not provide backups unless you pay for them. Others backup on a weekly or, in some cases, monthly basis. None of those methods are suitable if you are continually adding fresh content to your website.

Nexcess creates daily backups that are stored for 30 days. This is incredible. This ensures that you will never lose more than 24 hours' worth of material or updates. That can be aggravating, but it's nothing you can't fix with a few lattes and maybe some persistently upbeat music playing in the background while you work.

We can't express how wonderful it is to have daily backups provided. This is one of the most compelling reasons to choose Nexcess. Always make a backup of everything.
