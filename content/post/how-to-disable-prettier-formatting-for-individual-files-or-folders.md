**Good news!**

If you want to disable prettier from automatically formatting on just a single file or folder (or multiple files & folders) there is built-in functionality specifically for this - the `.prettierignore` file.

To disable prettier formatting on a single file, open the `.prettierignore` file and add the name of your file to the document.

To do this, you obviously must know 2 things:

1. where the `.prettierignore` file is located, so you can tell it which files to ignore

3. the correct syntax to use so the `.prettierignore` file understands

## where is the `.prettierignore` file located?

you create it. just put it in the right place.

create a new file calledÂ "`.prettierignore`"Â in the root folder of your project.

## how to add files and folders to .prettierignore (aka `.prettierignore` syntax)

the `.prettierignore file follows the .gitignore` syntax, so it would be a little redundant to re-hash that all here, but here are some of the most common scenarios.

### how to ignore all files in a folder with .prettierignore

1. create your `.prettierignore` file in the folder you want prettier to ignore the files inside of

3. inside the file, simply type `*` and save

`.prettierignore` file example:

```
*
```

### how to ignore specific files in a folder with `.prettierignore`

1. create your `.prettierignore` file in the root folder of your project

3. input the file names that you want to ignore. be sure to include the file extensions.

`.prettierignore` file example:

```
filename.txt
filename.csv
filename.whatever
```

![](/images/1prettierignore-file-example-1-1-1024x642-1.png)

telling `.prettierignore` to ignore the `test.html` file

![](/images/prettierignore-file-example-1b-1-1024x641-1.png)

look at how ugly that html file is.  
also note the bottom right of the screen that shows `X Prettier` showing that this file is not being prettier-ized.

## How to add inline `.prettierignore` inside of a specific file

this one is my favorite, because i typically open files directly without having their parent directory open in vs code - which i am noticing makes the `.prettierignore` file in the folder not work...

so, let's add some inline ignore syntax.

you write them basically the same way you write comments.

inline `.prettierignore` for markdown (MD)

```
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
whatever you write directly below will get ignored
```

and if you want to ignore a block / range / area / whatever of text:

```
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
now you can write multi-line things
and it wont format them!
which is super helpful for things like snippets, cheats, etc.

right?
just make sure to add the closing comment line someday...
like this
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
```
