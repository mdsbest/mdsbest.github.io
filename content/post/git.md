## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version management system that is free and open source. It is intended to manage modest to huge jobs quickly and efficiently. It is designed to help developers coordinate their efforts. We can track and collaborate with our team members at the same workplace thanks to version control.

Although Git is the backbone of several services such as GitHub and GitLab, we may utilize Git without needing any other Git services. Git is a tool that may be used both privately and publically.

Linus Torvalds founded Git in 2005 to help build the Linux kernel. It is also a critical distributed version-control tool for DevOps.

Git is simple to use and has a quick performance. It outperforms competing SCM tools such as Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase.

## Benefits of Git

A version control tool helps us to keep track of all the changes we make to our project's files. We can push updates to a repository every time we make modifications to files in an existing project. Other developers can grab your modifications from the repository and continue working with the adjustments you made to the project files.

### It saves time.

Git is a cutting-edge technology. Each command takes only a few seconds to perform, so we may save a significant amount of time when compared to logging onto a GitHub account and exploring its capabilities.

### Working While Not Connected

One of the most significant advantages of Git is that it allows for offline work. Our work will not be hampered if we have internet connectivity problems. We can perform practically anything locally in Git. Other CVS, such as SVN, are more constrained and prefer to link to a central repository.

### Correct Errors

Another advantage of Git is the ability to undo errors. Undo may sometimes be a lifesaver for us. Almost everything in Git has an undo option.

### Keep Track of the Changes

Git has several fascinating capabilities such as Diff, Log, and Status, which allow us to log changes and compare our files or branches.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a service for hosting Git repositories. Many of GitHub's features, including as access control and collaboration, also help. It has a graphical user interface that is accessible over the Internet.

GitHub is a firm based in the United States. It holds your project's source code in several programming languages and maintains track of the many modifications performed by programmers.

It supports Git's distributed version control and source code management (SCM). It also provides various collaboration tools for each project, such as issue tracking, feature requests, and task management.

GitHub is divided into two parts: the Git and the Hub. Access restrictions, as well as collaborative tools such as task management, repository hosting, and team administration, are available through the GitHub service.

The following are the main advantages of using GitHub:

- GitHub makes it simple to contribute to open source projects.

- It aids in the creation of a good paper.

- You may attract recruiters by displaying your work. You will have a better chance of being hired if you have a GitHub profile.

- It allows your work to be seen by the general audience.

- Changes in your code may be tracked between versions.

GitHub is a collaborative workspace for programmers and designers. They work together to cooperate, contribute, and fix issues. It offers a large number of open source projects and codes written in various programming languages.

The following are some of its key characteristics.

- Collaboration

- Tracking issues and bugs in one place

- Branches represented graphically

- Hosting for Git repositories

- Project administration

- Management of a group

- Hosting of code

- Keep track of and assign duties

- Conversations

- Wikisc

## Git Terminology

Git is a program with a lot of language and jargon, which may be confusing for new users or those who already know the basics but want to become Git masters. As a result, we require a brief explanation of the vocabulary used by the tools. Let's have a look at some of the most regularly used terminologies.

### @mention

Type @ before the username of the person you want to notify on GitHub. Members of a team on GitHub can also be other GitHub users.

### access token

When utilizing the command line or API to perform Git actions over HTTPS, a token is utilized in place of a password. Referred to as a personal identification token.

### API preview

New APIs and improvements to existing API methods can be tested before they are rolled out to all users.

### appliance

In the ideal world, an application with just enough operating system (JeOS) would be able to run on industry-standard hardware (such as a computer server or virtual machine).

### assignee

Whoever is allocated to work on a specific issue

### authentication code

Your GitHub password and this code are required when using two-factor authentication (2FA). To receive this code, you must use an app or have SMS texted to your phone to generate it. Another name for it is a "2FA authentication code."

### base branch

A pull request you've merged into your branch has been updated. Make use of the ability to change the repository's default branch when submitting a pull request.

### basic authentication

A technique of authentication in which the credentials are sent in plain text.

### bio

The following is an example of a profile's visitor-generated description: Incorporating a short biography into your online presence

### billing cycle

The length of time you've selected for your billing cycle.

### billing email

A business' email address is used by GitHub to send receipts, credit card and PayPal charges, and other billing-related communications.

### billing manager

The member of an organization who is in charge of a company's billing setup.

### billing plan

Invoices with a predetermined set of characteristics for individuals and companies.

### blame

The feature "blame" in Git displays the revision, author, and time of the most recent change to each line of a file. Finding out when a feature was added or which commit resulted in a specific bug is made easier with this information.

### block

To prevent a user from being able to collaborate on the organization's repositories.

### branch

Repositories can be broken down into sub-repositories known as branches. Allows you to operate without interfering with the "live" version, which is contained in the repository but not affected by it. It's time to merge your branch into the main one once you've finished your changes.

### branch restriction

Repository administrators have the ability to restrict which users or teams can push or make changes to a branch by enabling this restriction.

### Business plan

Unlimited repositories, the ability for your organization's users to authenticate to GitHub using SAML SSO, and provision and deprovision access via SAML or SCIM are all included in this plan.

### CA certificate

Certificate Authority (CA) issued digital certificates verifying connections between machines, such as GitHub.com and a user's PC, as well as the site's ownership.

### card

An issue or pull request is represented by a movable square on a project board.

### check

A check on GitHub is a form of status verification. "Status checks" can be found there.

### checkout

Working on two different branches of the same file is simple with git checkout \[branchname\] \[path to file\]. While performing "checkout," the working tree and its index and head are substituted for a single item or blob in the object database that points to a new branch.

### cherry-picking

Changes are recorded in a new codebase, and a new set of changes is made to the bigger set of changes (often commits). Changes introduced by an existing commit on another branch can be extracted and recorded as new commits using the git cherry-pick command in Git. For additional information on git-cherry-pick, go to the Git documentation.

### child team

Access rights and @mentions are passed down from the parent team to the child team inside a layered structure.

### clean

If a working tree matches the current HEAD revision, it's clean. In addition, "filthy" can be found here.

### clone

Cloning is the process of moving data from one area to another, such as a computer's hard disk. You don't need to be online to edit the files in your preferred editor and keep track of your changes with Git. In order to maintain synchronization between your local changes and the remote repository, you can do so as long as you're connected to the internet.

### clustering

GitHub Enterprise services can be distributed among multiple nodes and requests can be distributed among them.

### code frequency graph

In a repository graph, each week's material additions and removals are displayed.

### code of conduct

A document outlining the requirements for joining a group.

### code owner

Person assigned the responsibility of maintaining a certain area of source code within a repository. Pull requests that modify code that belongs to the code owner (and are not in draft mode) immediately trigger a review request to the code owner.

### collaborator

Someone who has been invited to contribute to a repository as a collaborator has been granted read and write access to the repository.

### commit

A "commit" or "revision" is a single change to a file (or set of files). Using Git's unique ID, you can keep track of the particular changes made to your work, as well as when they were made and by whom (sometimes called a "SHA" or "hash"). When making a new commit, a commit message provides a brief description of the changes that were made.

### commit author

An application's committer is the person who makes the final call.

### Commit graph

### compare branch

Pull requests are created from the branches in which they are located. Comparing this branch to its parent can reveal any differences in the pull request. In order to apply the modifications from the compare branch to the base branch, a pull request must be merged into the main branch. The "head branch" of a pull request is another name for it.

### continuous integration

CI is another name for it. An automated build and test procedure is launched when someone contributes changes to a GitHub repository. In software development, continuous integration (CI) is a standard best practice for spotting errors early on.

### contribution graph

The day-by-day breakdown of a user's contributions over the course of a year.

### contribution guidelines

### dashboard

Your activities on GitHub are organized around your personal dashboard. From your own dashboard, you can visit your favorite repositories and team sites, track the bugs and pull requests you're working on, and learn about recent activity in the repositories you're watching or participating in. Additionally, you can discover new repositories by following the individuals you follow and staring the ones you prefer. Examine your organization's dashboard to see only actions pertaining to your organization. Additional information is available under "About your personal dashboard" or "About your organization dashboard."

### default branch

The primary branch in a git repository from which fresh pull requests and code contributions can be made. When a repository is created, Git automatically produces at least one branch. The main branch is sometimes referred to as just "the first one," but there are other names for it, such as "the default."

### dependents graph

A public repository dependency graph shows all the packages, projects, and repositories that are dependent on it.

### dependency graph

A visual representation of the dependencies of the repository's packages and projects.

### deploy key

The deploy key on your server is an SSH key that enables you access to a single repository of your choice. Rather of being associated with the user's personal account, this key is associated with the repository.

### detached HEAD

Your commits will not be displayed in the commit history when you are working on a detachable HEAD, because Git isn't pointing to a branch at that time. Using a "detached HEAD" means, for example, checking out a commit that is not part of any specific branch's most recent commit.

### diagnostics

Uncover how to set up and manage an enterprise-level GitHub infrastructure in this quick guide.

### diff

A diff is a comparison of the changes made between two commits or changes saved to the repository. By inspecting the diff, you may determine what modifications have been done to a file since the last commit.

### dirty

When changes are made to a working tree but not yet reflected in the current branch, it is referred to as "dirty."

### email notifications

Email is used to provide notifications to the user's inbox.

### Explorer

A "graphical interactive in-browser GraphQL integrated development environment."

### fast-forward

As the name implies, you're "merging" changes from one branch that is a descendent of the revision you currently have into your current branch via a fast-forward merge. A new merging commit is not required in this instance; instead, simply update to the most recent version. On a regular basis, this will occur on the remote-tracking branch of a remote repository.

### feature branch

A non-production branch is used to evaluate a new feature or fix a problem. Often referred to as a topical subdivision.

### fenced code block

Adding triple backticks "' before and after a code block in GitHub Flavored Markdown creates an indented chunk of code. An example is shown below.

### fetch

[Fetching changes from a remote repository into your local working branch without committing them to the remote repository is what happens when you use the git](https://devinschumacher.com/git-fetch/) fetch command. You can check changes before they are committed to your local branch by fetching them.

### following (users)

To keep abreast on the contributions and activity of other users.

### force push

Any local modifications are applied to the remote repository, even if there are conflicts.

### fork

You can think of it as an individual copy of another user's repository that you've made for your own use on GitHub. With forks, you can make changes to a project without relying on the source code. In order to keep your fork up to date with the most recent modifications, you can open a pull request in the upstream repository.

### Free plan

### push a branch

When you successfully push your local branch to a remote repository, the remote repository's branch is updated with the changes from your local branch. When you "push a branch," Git searches the remote repository for the branch's HEAD ref and verifies that it is an ancestor of the branch's local HEAD ref. After validating that all objects available from the local HEAD ref but not in the remote repository have been added to the remote object database, Git changes the remote HEAD ref. The push fails if the remote HEAD is not a direct ancestor of the local HEAD.

As an example, consider a software that runs on a regular basis and repairs faults that have been overlooked for a long time. In a firm with a restricted number of licenses for GitHub applications, a server-to-server bot does not consume one of your GitHub licenses because these applications do not require a GitHub account. To retrieve a token for a server-to-server request, the GitHub API is used. For more details, see "user-to-server request."

### service hook

### topic branch

A developer will utilize a regular branch of the Git software to show where their work is going. In many circumstances, having a large number of smaller branches with well-defined concepts or tiny incremental changes that all work together is a wise approach. This particular sub-branch is also known as a "feature branch."

### topics

Using a repository's search function, you can look for projects to work on and discover new GitHub solutions.

### traffic graph

It shows how many full clones (not fetches) a repository has had, how many visitors have come in the last 14 days, and what content was most popular during that time period.
