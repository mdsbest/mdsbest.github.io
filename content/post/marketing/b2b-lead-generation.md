## What is B2B lead generation?

**B2B lead generation definition**: B2B lead gen is the _art_ of earning attention from people who can purchase your product or service.

By generating new leads you’re able to keep the business running because it means sales will hit their numbers, the product will hit their numbers, and ultimately your business lives to see another day. 

There are plenty of strategies and tactics you can employ to accomplish this goal, and we’re going to touch on them later in this article, but for now, you need to know 1 key difference in generating leads for B2B compared to B2C lead gen. 

### B2B vs.B2C Lead Generation

The strategies you use for B2B lead generation compared to B2C will not prove to be as effective. Period.

B2B lead generation involves selling into corporations that have entire teams dedicated to purchasing from vendors. If you’re targeting corporations, especially Enterprise organizations, you must convince multiple people - sometimes up to 6 or 8 individuals - that you’re the perfect vendor for their problem. 

No easy feat. 

You’ll need to learn how to create content for every different phase of the sales cycle, and each piece will need to be specifically geared to overcome certain objections if you want to close the deal. 

- **Recommended Reading**: [What is Lead Generation](https://devinschumacher.com/what-is-lead-generation/), [Lead Generation Tools](https://devinschumacher.com/lead-generation-tools/)

However, with B2C lead generation, you’re only convincing 1 person to purchase from you, and the tactics and strategies you employ are going to vary wildly from B2B strategies. 

Here’s a good breakdown of the differences between the 2:

**Pro Tip** - You can amp your content up another notch by creating a killer video ad and retargeting the prospects who didn’t sign up the first time.

Hopefully the picture is clear.

If you want to generate a boatload of leads for your business, you must do an analysis of the resources you have available and decide on how you’re going to use the different tactics thoughtfully. 

This is not easy, and is why Chief Marketing Officers get paid the big bucks - they understand this thoroughly. 

Now, before going into the tactics and how they’ll help, you need to understand the 2 sub-strategies to generating B2B leads. 

1. **Inbound** 

And…

2. **Outbound**

2. Design An Amazing Cover

You know how they say never judge a book by it’s cover - well in B2B lead generation you can throw that phrase out the window. 

People download because it looks cool.

3. Add A Large Variety Of High Quality Images

Excellent copy, an interesting topic, and stunning images - this is what leads to a successful ebook. You must have a designer handle your visuals for you, or use Canva if you can!

##### Infographics

##### Template or Checklist 

Such a fantastic choice of content because of how actionable it is to the end user. They don’t take a lot of time or money to create, and your prospects will love them if they’re aimed at keeping them focused on the goal at hand. 

Here’s a quick example of what a good checklist looks like:

### Affiliate Marketing

What if you could have an army of sales people, all very hungry for a healthy commission, do the selling for your product absolutely free? 

This is what affiliate marketing can do for you, and for some it’s one of the most lucrative things they’ve ever done, because they know the real money is made on the backend. 

![](/images/sales-tricks-to-get-business-leads.gif)

Your first goal with cold calling is to get the prospect to pause, just for a second, and snap out of their automatic response. Your next goal is to sell a 15-20 minute discovery call. You’re not trying to sell the product, only a meeting, and you do this by demonstrating 3 things: 

1. You’re enthusiastic as hell.
2. You’re a force to be reckoned with.
3. You’re sharp as a tac. 

If you can demonstrate these 3 things, within the first 5 seconds, you’ll get your prospects attention and the chance to convince them why they should listen to you. 

### Direct Mail

Look - I’m going to level straight with you. If you have the budget, and you know - like you really know - your product will benefit a list of targeted prospects, then direct mail is one of the coolest and most memorable ways of generating B2B leads. 

Yes, the cost-per-lead will be a bit pricey, but you’re going to get a lot more qualified conversations by crafting a really great direct mail campaign instead of just sending them an email drop. 

Here are a couple examples of great direct mail campaigns with huge ROI…

Google used direct mail to gain 1000’s of new advertising clients:

Many claim the press release is dead because of social media taking over the news cycle, and what used to be an almost guarantee of going viral is now something of just another drop in the vast news ocean.

The reason press releases are hit-or-miss is due to the lack of control you have with them. You’re typically only allowed to write factual, non-sales, style copy and depending on the circulation it can be hard to get in front of the right audience. 

Don’t get me wrong, if you [do your press releases correctly by pairing it with SEO](https://devinschumacher.com/pr-seo/) and [social media](https://devinschumacher.com/what-is-social-media-marketing/) you can generate some real buzz, but it’s a multi-channel approach in order to generate quality leads which can raise the lead cost. 

### TV / Radio Ads

There are 2 competing perspectives when it comes to TV and radio advertising.

First, according to Forrestor Research over 80% of CMO’s believe traditional television advertising is less effective.

Second, Burst Media did a study and found that over 50% of all internet users think television captures their interest most effectively.

So what does this mean for B2B lead generation?

Well… Both are true. In fact here’s a visual of how advertising is trending.

Here’s another example: if you’re an agency you can provide some type of easy analysis your prospects can use to improve their website or advertising. 

This type of idea is excellent for top of funnel generation, but you’ll need a good follow up sequence to ensure they get more qualification to become a truly qualified lead. 

## B2B Lead Generation Tools

When it comes to lead generation tools there too many tools out there to keep up with the pace.

However, you need to know that there are certain aspects you’ll need tools for, so do your due diligence in determining which tools are necessary for right now.
