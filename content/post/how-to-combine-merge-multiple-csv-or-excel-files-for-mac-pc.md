## How do i combine multiple files into one file?

Relax! I'm getting there..

Just kidding - i just needed to stuff that [keyword](https://devinschumacher.com/seo-keywords/) phrase to pick up a couple more terms for [SEO](https://devinschumacher.com/what-is-seo/) purposes.

But actually there's a few ways to do it:

- **Merge CSVs at the command line** (how we are going to do it today)

- **Merge CSVs with a** [free csv merge tool](https://serp.co/tools/combine-csv-files/) I made for ya

- **Merge CSVs with python**

- Merge CSVs by smashing them together with hulk hands (not a real method)

In this article (and video) I will show you **how to quickly & easily combine and merge multiple CSV files into one CSV file for free on a mac using the terminal** -- but it also works on PCs.

If you run into any problems - we even created a free tool that you can try.

So follow along, and start combining!

Update: Back in the day I shot a video about how to do this manually on a mac, and it still works. But since then we've had a lot of people ask about doing it on a PC.

So we actually just made a tool that combines CSVs for you.

And it's way faster than the manual method.

And it's free.

ðŸ‘‰ Here's a link to the tool for all you lazies who don't wanna read or watch a video: [https://serp.co/tools/combine-csv-files/](https://serp.co/tools/combine-csv-files/)

## Step 1 - Create a new folder

Create a new folder on your Desktop & put all of your CSV files into the folder.

I will call mine "combine".

**  
It will look like this:  
**

![](/images/1-Create-a-new-folder-on-your-Desktop-put-all-of-your-CSV-files-into-the-folder.png)

**Caution**: Everything in this folder will be combined.

## Step 2 - Open Terminal (aka "the shell" or "the command line")

The program "Terminal" is located in your "[Applications](https://devinschumacher.com/how-to-completely-delete-applications-on-mac-full-uninstallation/)" folder under "Utilities"

### Applications > Utilities > Terminal

![](/images/2-The-program-Terminal-is-located-in-your-Applications-folder-under-Utilities.png)

Open Terminal.

**  
It will look like this:  
**

## Step 3 - Print Working Directory

This is a fancy name. Don't worry about it, just follow the steps.

1. Type: `pwd`

3. Hit the `return` key

```
pwd
```

**  
It will look like this:  
**

`pwd` means "print working directory". It's showing you what "directory" (aka folder) you are currently at on your operating system. Don't worry about it. Just keep following along.

## Step 4 - Choose the folder you created

Set your "directory" to the folder you created that has your CSV files in it.

1. type: `cd /Users/devin/Desktop/combine` <== obviously replace "devin" with your name... unless your name is devin.

3. hit the `return` key

**Note**: you will need to change your file path so it matches your username & folder name

## Step 5 - Merge the files

Now you are ready to merge your files.

1. type: `cat *.csv >combined.csv`

3. hit the `return` key

**  
It will look like this:  
**

![](/images/6-Now-you-are-ready-to-merge-your-files..png)

## Step 6 - Check your folder

If you followed along correctly, you are done!

Inside your folder there will be a file called "combined.csv", which contains all of your csv files combined together.

Note: you might have to delete the duplicate header columns though.

Just apply a filter to your entire sheet, and sort A-Z on column A and you should see them.

**It will look like this:**
