**White Hat SEO**: The first dumbest term in Search Engine Optimization.

[Here is the second dumbest.](https://devinschumacher.com/black-hat-seo/)

White Hat SEO is even more of a misnomer than Black Hat SEO.

## What is White Hat SEO?

White Hat SEO is colloquially to refer to as safe, legit, or sustainable SEO practices, that you probably "should concentrate on".

That's really it!

"Good SEO".

**White Hat SEO is**: The Light Side of The Force

It has a good connotation because "White Hat SEO" practices are typically more sustainable and less short lived than black hat seo.

If you have read our [article about black hat seo](https://devinschumacher.com/black-hat-seo/) then you know my feelings about labeling something Black vs. White hat in the SEO game because they are both the same.

At least with [Black hat SEO](https://devinschumacher.com/black-hat-seo/) the practices are a bit MORE shady. But with "White Hat SEO" this is totally a wrong definition because White Hat SEOs are 100% trying to influence/manipulate their search engine rankings. And that is **definitely** against Google's TOS.

A better name for it would be "Hypocrite SEO"

Guys, I know we joke alot about bad vs. good in these Black Hat & White Hat debates, **but the bottom line is this**:

If you run a business that you want to spend time, money, effort & energy building for the long term - then it is probably best you try and stick to the **least risky** things possible.

I hope thats obvious.

Be safe out there, for the internet is dark and full of terrors (and GIFs, apparently).

So for the rest of the article, we will leave this philosophical debate and focus on giving you some actionable tips about White hat SEO.

**White Hat SEO is**: Safety First.

## White Hat SEO, Explained

What Google wants you to do instead is "prepare" your content in a way that helps THEM organize it better.

Really, what they have done, is create this [$80 billion dollar industry](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2018/07/30/seo-industry-approaching-80-billion-but-all-you-want-is-more-web-traffic/#76dfc2557337) of people who are working for Google without Google actually paying them.

Google publishes their list of guidelines of what they WANT you to do (notice I didn't say "a list of guidelines of what will make your site rank better", although there is some overlap) so that you will spend your time preparing (optimizing) your website so it's easier for their web-crawler, [Googlebot](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/182072?hl=en), to understand your site better and make their life easier.

**Here are some of Google resources for what you should do as an SEO (this would be the closest thing to White Hat SEO):**

- [Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Starter Guide](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184?hl=en)

- [Google Webmaster Guidelines](http://Webmaster Guidelines)

- [Google Search Quality Raters Guidelines](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Google-Search-Quality-Rater-Guidelines.pdf)

Okay so thats like 200+ pages of super boring dry reading.

I know you're not here for that. #TLDR (Too Long, Didn't Read)

![](/images/too-long-didnt-read-gif.gif)

The key takeaway here is that Google is not going to give out its secret formula to ranking on its [search engine](https://devinschumacher.com/search-engines/).

That would be stupid.

Instead, it's going to publish a bunch of information (and much misinformation) that is actually geared towards making the algorithm's job much easier. So it can take information of all of our websites (me and you included) and display it to it's users on the [SERP](https://devinschumacher.com/serp/) (search engine results page).

My prediction, is that one day Google SERP clicks are going to go so low, because all the information a searcher needs will be displayed ON the SERP, and there will not even be a need to click through to the actual website.

**For example**: no need to go to NFL.com anymore for the scores

So that is why "White Hat SEO" is a misnomer, just like [black hat seo](https://devinschumacher.com/black-hat-seo/).

We SEOs use it to say "what kind of SEO tactics and tricks can we do that Google "approves". But really, Google just wants you organizing your site, not building "good links" and "guest posting", etc. More on this later.

**White Hat SEO** is: slower, but safer

White Hat SEO is the term we (not Google) give to label certain search engine optimization tactics/strategies as 'safe' or 'sustainable' for your website. Whereas Black hat seo would signify the search engine optimization tactics/strategies that are 'risky' for your website.

## White Hat SEO Techniques & Tactics

So now that you understand what White Hat SEO is, let's talk about some of the generally accepted white hat seo techniques, tactics, tricks & strategies that you can use in your business and feel generally safe about (there is always a risk of doing something wrong, or Google changing their mind about what they like, but you can't live your entire life on what-ifs. Get out there and SEO a little).

> **Pro tip:** One easy distinction to understand if what you are about to do is white hat seo vs. black hat seo, is look at how much automating & mass producing you are doing. If you are using bots, scrapers, spinners, and producing and/or sending out non-personalized information, it's probably closer to black hat.
