# 60+ Awesome Dental Marketing Ideas, Strategies & Tips to Grow Your Practice

![](/images/Devin.jpg)BY: DEVIN SCHUMACHER // Head of Marketing / [SERP Dental](https://devinschumacher.com/dental/)This list of dental marketing ideas comes from experience working with dentists and other local service providers.I have used these strategies to have helped our clients build dental practices of all sizes and stages of growth. I hope this information is as helpful for you as it has been profitable for our clients!

##### #1 Dental Marketing Idea

### START A BLOG

Blogs can be a great way to generate traffic to your website. People will click through if you give them topical, informative articles with headlines like “10 Tips for Preventing Gum Disease” or “What You Need to Know About Veneers.”

##### #2 Dental Marketing Idea

### ANSWER FAQS

Establish an FAQ (frequently asked questions) page on your website. Not only will it reduce the number of inquiries to your clinic, but it can also be used to promote discounts, services, treatment options and other things that you’d like potential patients to know.

##### #3 Dental Marketing Idea

### BUILD A SITEMAP

Sitemaps can help you rise in search engine results pages (SERPs) by gathering all of your data and presenting it in an easy-to-read format for the search engines themselves. They’re basically road maps for the algorithm systems used by companies like Google.![](/images/Dental-banner1.jpg)

##### #7 Dental Marketing Idea

### UTILIZE ANALYTICS SOFTWARE

Analytics software can help you track, record, organize and analyze the traffic flowing to and from your website. The most well-known brand is Google Analytics, but there are other kinds that you can use as well.

##### #8 Dental Marketing Idea

### OFFER HEALTH SCREENINGS

Health screenings are provided by everyone from podiatrists to cardiologists. However, it’s rare to see a dentist enter the mix. You can get a lot of fresh sign-ups if you’re willing to break the mold and offer free or low-cost health screenings at your clinic.

##### #9 Dental Marketing Idea

### EDUCATE YOURSELF ON SEO

Search engine optimization (SEO) is the bread and butter of online advertising. Whenever you look for dental marketing solutions, SEO strategies will dominate the list. Start doing your homework on SEO and how it can help you.

##### #10 Dental Marketing Idea

### CREATE INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS

One of the most efficient dental marketing strategies is to create how-to videos that can be hosted on your website or social media account. You’ll get clicks from all around the world as people search for flossing techniques or wisdom teeth removal.

##### #11 Dental Marketing Idea

### TURN THE CHANNEL

Television and radio ads can increase your visibility among local residents. Even if they don’t need your services today, they’ll remember your jingle from hearing it on the radio every morning, and they’ll be more likely to contact you when they crack a tooth.

##### #12 Dental Marketing Idea

### JOIN LOCAL EVENTS AND ACTIVITIES

 Hand out water bottles at a triathlon. Distribute key chains at local business conferences. Just make sure that your name, logo and phone number is on all of your freebies.![](/images/Marketing-ideas-dental-office.jpg)[Let's Review Your Website!](https://devinschumacher.com/contact/)

##### #13 Dental Marketing Idea

### BUST OUT THE BACKLINKS

Backlinks are one of the most important metrics used by search engines when determining a website’s authority. The good news is that it’s relatively easy to start using backlinks on your own sites, blogs and social media accounts.

##### #14 Dental Marketing Idea

### AUTHOR AN EBOOK

eBooks can be used to share your knowledge of dental problems and procedures. If you make them downloadable on your website, they’ll also become a focal point for your expertise.

##### #15 Dental Marketing Idea

### UPGRADE YOUR WAITING ROOM

Throw out those dusty magazines and bring in books, movies, puzzles, board games and coloring supplies for adults and kids alike. People will definitely comment on your top-tier waiting room in their reviews.

##### #16 Dental Marketing Idea

### RESHAPE YOUR BUSINESS CARDS

If you’re still using plain white squares, you’re missing out on prime opportunities for memorable marketing. Think about something colorful or something shaped like teeth, toothbrushes or gums.

##### #17 Dental Marketing Idea

### HIRE GUEST BLOGGERS

Once you’ve created a blog, it’s important not to drone on with the same topics and the same “voices.” Feature some guest bloggers to give it variety and credibility as a blog written by and for well-informed individuals.

##### #18 Dental Marketing Idea

### DON’T NEGLECT PRINT MEDIA

Print media might be on the decline as businesses become increasingly digital, but there’s still power in old-fashioned billboards and bus stop flyers. In fact, without a lot of competition, print ads can be a surprisingly effective and creative dental marketing plan.[Let's Review Your Website!](https://devinschumacher.com/contact/)![](/images/Dental-banner2.jpg)[Let's Review Your Website!](https://devinschumacher.com/contact/)

##### #19 Dental Marketing Idea

### ASK FOR PATIENT TESTIMONIALS

If the patient is smiling as they leave your clinic, ask them to give a testimonial before they go. You can use their praise everywhere from commercials to radio ads.

##### #20 Dental Marketing Idea

### CREATE A MOBILE VERSION OF YOUR WEBSITE

This is one of those marketing tips for dentists that sounds obvious but is still crucial to the success of your business. More than two-thirds of people use phones and tablets rather than traditional computers. Your site needs a good mobile display to accommodate them.

##### #21 Dental Marketing Idea

### TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING TOOLS

Facebook offers Facebook Ads. Instagram and Twitter allow you to create “sponsored” content. Don’t be afraid to play around with the different on-site advertising tools of your chosen social media platforms.

##### #22 Dental Marketing Idea

### JOIN DISCOUNT SERVICE PROVIDERS

Places like Groupon and LivingSocial can be a big boon for your business. You’ll need to take a financial hit by offering deals and discounts to attract new patients, but consider it an investment for the future.

##### #23 Dental Marketing Idea

### EXPERIMENT WITH PAY-PER-CLICK ADS

Pay-per-click (PPC) ads are one of the most effective ways to bring unique views to your website. You’ll need to do some research to make sure that you’re utilizing them correctly, but they’ll be worth it in the end.

##### #24 Dental Marketing Idea

### SET UP LEAD BOXES

You don’t always need to think outside of the box. Sometimes, the box itself is a great dental marketing idea. Lead boxes are both fun and functional, and they can generate a lot of interest in your brand.

##### #25 Dental Marketing Idea

### PURCHASE A CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK

A customer service kiosk will allow your patients to check themselves in and handle their own payment arrangements. Not only will it cut down on appointment times, but you can also feature it in your advertisements to bring attention to your modern, convenient practice.

##### #26 Dental Marketing Idea

### UPGRADE YOUR GRAPHICS

The best graphics are crisp and colorful. They don’t have any blurry backgrounds or pixelated portions, and they reflect the high-quality nature of your practice by existing as high-definition images. You might need to invest in a new DSLR for this.

##### #27 Dental Marketing Idea

### GO OUT TO DINNER

Dinner talks can be given to clients, vendors, investors and other business leaders in your area. They’re an excellent but underutilized promotional tool in the world of dentistry.

##### #28 Dental Marketing Idea

### CREATE VIRAL VIDEOS

Do the Harlem shake in your hallway. Dance in your offices to Gangnam Style. If you’re looking for creative dental marketing ideas, this is one to consider. It won’t be suitable for every clinic, of course, but if you have a reputation for friendliness, it can cement that impression.

##### #29 Dental Marketing Idea

### DIVERSIFY YOUR KEYWORDS

Your keyword list should be more comprehensive than “dentist” or “dental clinic.” It should also include things like “cavities,” “braces,” “sore gums” and “teeth whitening costs.”

##### #30 Dental Marketing Idea

### HAVE FUN WITH FREEBIES

Everyone loves a freebie. Whether it’s pens, pencils, notepads, key chains or sugar-free lollipops, there’s always something that you can give to patients to thank them for their business.![](/images/Dental-banner4.jpg)[Let's Review Your Website!](https://devinschumacher.com/contact/)

##### #31 Dental Marketing Idea

### ENCOURAGE VISITOR ENGAGEMENT

Your website should make it easy for readers to like, share and bookmark any content that interests them. Include all of these options on your display panels.

##### #32 Dental Marketing Idea

### IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF YOUR TITLE TAGS

Your keyword list should be more comprehensive than “dentist” or “dental clinic.” It should also include things like “cavities,” “braces,” “sore gums” and “teeth whitening costs.”

##### #30 Dental Marketing Idea

### CLEAN UP YOUR REVIEWS

If you’ve gotten any middling reviews on third-party websites like Yelp, it’s time to do some damage control. While you won’t be able to remove them, you can usually respond to them, and that will go a long way towards helping your brand reputation.

##### #34 Dental Marketing Idea

### JOIN YOUR LOCAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

Not only will this increase your legitimacy in the eyes of your patients, but it will also provide networking opportunities with other businesses in your area. You never know when that will pay off for your practice.

##### #35 Dental Marketing Idea

### TOGGLE BETWEEN SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS

Even if you have a favorite platform, you shouldn’t neglect the others that you’ve signed up for, especially if you’ve linked to them on your website. You don’t want patients to find a tumbleweed account and assume that you’re no longer in business.

##### #36 Dental Marketing Idea

### OFFER LUXURY SERVICES

You might not have the funds for a full-time masseuse, but you can hire one for a special “Get Over Your Fear of the Dentist” weekend. You’ll also generate a lot of good buzz for your company with the creativity of the gesture.

##### #37 Dental Marketing Idea

### SHOWCASE YOUR SPECIALTIES

While it’s great to cover a wide variety of topics with your website, don’t become one of those shallow, surface-level sites that fails to engage patients on a meaningful level. Have a couple of specialty interests that show off your expertise.

##### #38 Dental Marketing Idea

### SCHEDULE A LUNCH-AND-LEARN

A lunch-and-learn is a chance to connect with potential patients in your area. It can be especially helpful if you coordinate with relevant businesses and insurance companies. For example, if your clinic is listed in the network of Company A’s health plan, you can organize a lunch-and-learn at Company A to encourage its employees to choose you.

##### #39 Dental Marketing Idea

### GET SNEAKY WITH YOUR SEO

There are certain SEO tricks that can drive even more traffic to your website. For example, did you know that you can put your keywords in your alt-text for images? Search engines will still count them, but they won’t over-stuff the webpage itself.![](/images/Dental-banner6.jpg)[Let's Review Your Website!](https://devinschumacher.com/contact/)

##### #40 Dental Marketing Idea

### ENGAGE WITH OTHER BLOGS AND ARTICLES

 Leave comments on teeth whitening articles written by other people. Answer questions about cavities and crowns on sites like Yahoo Answers. It’ll get your name out there, especially if you link to your own website as a reference point.

##### #41 Dental Marketing Idea

### VERIFY YOUR WEBSITE

If you haven’t verified your website with search engines like Google and Bing, it’s time to get it done. This small action can have huge benefits down the line.

##### #42 Dental Marketing Idea

### SEND OUT REMINDERS TO PAST PATIENTS

It’s easier to retain an old customer than to find a new one. If it’s been awhile since Sally Smith had a check-up, send her an email or postcard that offers her a special deal for coming back to your clinic.

##### #43 Dental Marketing Idea

### ADVERTISE IN UNEXPECTED PLACES

The nice thing about dental marketing tips is that they can be applied to every form of food on the planet. Whether it’s the packaging of a cookie or the inside of a pizza box, you can advertise your services anywhere that people eat.

##### #44 Dental Marketing Idea

### CREATE EMAIL NEWSLETTERS

This is one of those old-school dentist marketing ideas that can still make a splash if you approach it correctly. Don’t use email newsletters as stuffy press releases. Use them as fun, engaging advertisements for your most recent sales or blog posts.

##### #45 Dental Marketing Idea

### OFFER A VIRTUAL TOUR

With so many people afraid of the dentist, it can help to calm their nerves if you offer a virtual tour of your clinic. There are plenty of low-cost programs that will make it easy for you to set up.

##### #46 Dental Marketing Idea

### SUPER-SIZE YOUR ADS

Billboards don’t always offer the greatest ROI, but if you’re located near a major highway or shopping center, they might be worth the expense. This is especially true if you advertise that walk-ins are welcome.

##### #47 Dental Marketing Idea

### JOIN SEARCH-AND-DISCOVERY APPS

Search-and-discovery apps like Foursquare and Gowalla can put you on the radar of people looking for local dental services. However, you might need to reach out and join the app to make sure that your clinic is listed.

##### #48 Dental Marketing Idea

### GO GUERILLA

Guerilla marketing is a low-cost way to spread the word about your practice. Instead of spending a lot of money on flyers, commercials and sponsorships, you just hit the streets. It’s worth considering if you’re a new or struggling clinic without the budget for expensive ad campaigns.

##### #49 Dental Marketing Idea

### HOST A KID-FRIENDLY EVENT OR WORKSHOP

Pediatric dentists, this one is for you. Organize a children’s day that will draw in new patients and their parents. You can arrange all kinds of tours, prizes, giveaways, educational exhibits and question-and-answer sessions for the crowd.

##### #50 Dental Marketing Idea

### BRING MORE ATTENTION TO YOUR BUTTONS

Your social media and RSS buttons shouldn’t be hidden at the bottom of your website. Put them in a prominent position where they’re easily noticed and clicked by your visitors.

##### #51 Dental Marketing Idea

### DISTRIBUTE REFERRAL CARDS

Referral cards are another one of those throwback dentist marketing strategies that have fallen out of favor with the rise of the digital revolution, but it doesn’t hurt to try them. They aren’t a significant investment, and if they don’t recoup their costs, it’s easy to discontinue them.![](/images/Dental-banner5.jpg)[Let's Review Your Website!](https://devinschumacher.com/contact/)

##### #52 Dental Marketing Idea

### POST ON ARTICLE SUBMISSION SITES

Article submission sites allow you to post content on their website. They can be a valuable tool for reaching new audiences, improving keyword visibility and building authority for your brand.

##### #53 Dental Marketing Idea

### DOUBLE-CHECK YOUR DIRECTORIES

Many people use directories to find dental offices with particular services, prices or locations. However, if the information listed on the directory is inaccurate, you could miss out on a lot of potential patients. Make sure that you’ve verified everything.

##### #54 Dental Marketing Idea

### GET AFFILIATED

Affiliations with other websites can help to establish your own site as a legitimate source of information. Do some research into figuring out the best affiliations for your practice.

##### #55 Dental Marketing Idea

### SPONSOR LOCAL GROUPS AND ORGANIZATIONS

From renting out your office space to funding certain activities in exchange for brand promotion, there are many ways to sponsor a local group. All of them can bring new customers to your clinic.

##### #56 Dental Marketing Idea

### ALLOW COMMENTS ON YOUR BLOG

Open up the comments section of your blog. This will give it a friendly, interactive feeling and allow patients to ask questions and express their opinions on the content that you’ve posted. It will also increase engagement on your website as a whole.

##### #57 Dental Marketing Idea

### RECOGNIZE THE POWER OF CANDY

As a dentist, you might be tempted to swear off all forms of candy, but you can generate more leads by harnessing rather than ignoring its power. For example, you can have your clinic’s phone number custom-printed on candy wrappers and Popsicle sticks.

##### #58 Dental Marketing Idea

### USE HASHTAGS

Hashtags are the key to getting yourself noticed on social media. In addition to standard things like #dentist and #teeth, be sure that you’re also engaging with current, relevant trends like #ThrowbackThursday.

##### #59 Dental Marketing Idea

### SUPPORT LOCAL CHARITIES

This will give your brand some fantastic media coverage. Every time that someone looks you up on a search engine, they’ll see news articles that detail your generosity.

##### #60 Dental Marketing Idea

### CREATE A MARKETING CALENDAR

Last but certainly not least, create a marketing calendar that details and organizes all of your dental office marketing ideas. It can be used to determine how much or how little that you’re doing on the average day. If the numbers are too low for your liking, you’ll be able to recognize that and pick up the pace.
