## What Makes a Good Lead Generation Tool?

There are a handful of tools, but not all will help business owners hit every sweet spot of web-based lead generation. 

The best lead generation tools enable you to capture your audience’s interest, increase the customer base, and maximize sales.

Usability is one thing you should look out for since capturing qualified leads becomes easy, eliminating the need to perform complicated coding by yourself. 

You should also be able to share data between two tools seamlessly.

Pricing is essential because you want a tool offering the right features without spending more. 

Overall, settle with a lead generation tool that’ll help you achieve the goals you couldn’t hit before.

## What is a Lead?

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/o6nUtwVKnYU-WzwVpnGxeaFD7WewfKlD8yDd5XcO9uQBxaVv_ZdtJ9ltgflZHSMf4eJxn6m4YMYZkFPp94CNyYVpAOU5nL7QEcMglAPLJRbzbf99_a9KKaOfHQwDiEpavHlMTVzV)

A lead is an organization or individual interested in your products or services. 

To anticipate interest, the individual or organization will contact you and share their personal information like their phone number, social media handles, and email ID. This is something to note as having tons of visitors on your website may not translate into leads if you don’t have their names and email addresses.

## What Is a “Qualified Lead”?

A qualified lead is an individual who could become a potential customer, and businesses base it on the information someone has freely provided. Simply put, no cold prospecting or purchased email lists will count as a qualified lead.

## What are the Different Types of Leads?

Securing sales leads isn’t a walkover, especially for businesses that aren’t aware of the leads they invest their energy in. 

You need to understand how to handle and utilize several leads to witness their full benefits.

Below are the top leads every organization or business owner should understand.

**Marketing Qualified Leads (MQL)**

MQL is a common type of sales lead, and as the name suggests, it turns into a prospect because of your marketing efforts. Most MQLs could have watched a video about your business that attracted them or attended a webinar.

For you to qualify someone as MQL, you’ll need to gather early insights like email address, company name, industrial or vertical, and one or two personal questions. Such leads need additional marketing assistance to prepare them for a sales call.

**Sales Qualified Lead (SQL)**

An SQL is a prospective buyer who has been researched and vetted by an organization’s marketing department, followed by its sales team. Such customers are deemed ready for the sales process since they have met a company’s lead qualification criteria.

Organizations need to set and test this definition because there may be adjustments designed to fit the buying patterns and market changes. The only difference between MQL and SQL is the readiness to buy.

**Sales Accepted Lead (SAL)**

A Sales Accepted Lead is an MQL that has been gauged and passed along to the sales team for approval. The sales team measures the qualification score using upon-agreed criteria once a prospective shows all the positive signs to become a lead.

Adopting the SAL process strengthens your follow-up efforts, eliminates the risk of losing potential leads, ensures timely follow-ups, and aligns the marketing teams.

**Product Qualified Lead (PQL)**

A Product Qualified Lead (PQL) is an individual who has experienced value from using your products through a freemium model or free trial. Unlike MQLs, who determine the buying intent with website visits and white-paper downloads, PQLs are mostly tied to a meaningful value.

However, PQLs aren’t people who have upgraded their free plans and signed up for free trials. PQLs, if defined correctly, can be a competitive advantage for your brand.

## What is Lead Generation?

Lead generation is the marketing process of identifying and converting people on your website into customers. Most business owners think the process is all about sending a bunch of emails or cold calling, but it isn’t.

Instead, for lead generation to be effective, you must persuade potential customers using a diverse range of strategies. By doing so, you’ll build trust with your audience while educating them about your industry and offerings.

## The Importance of Lead Generation

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/nPgC3LZexWRZWFdE1naenFEEUHGmbh_KlsrcojUHsLWvdNsF_xB56IFK4GFjGqJX9LuMfRcaU3529dP2lQIyygFbVBsuDDq9z_CEN_DzFu7YbNuYItuWdCZwDE8ikYVfLoCXKrxU)

With the increased competition, marketing methods like email blasts aren’t enough for companies to track, reach, and attract potential customers.

Read on to learn what to expect from your lead generation efforts, and some of the key points that it helps your business to accomplish.

## Generate Awareness

A lead generation educates potential customers about your products and services and how unique they are from competitors. It makes it easy for customers to think of your company first when they need to purchase anything within your product category.

Once lead generation grabs their attention, it creates awareness about your brand, increasing the chances of the lead buying from your business.

## It’s Cheaper than other Forms of Advertisements

Advertising is an essential tool if you want your business to succeed, but it isn’t cheap. Startups or established companies should be mindful of how they spend their money by finding cost-effective strategies.

Lead generation saves time and costs by targeting and connecting with prospects that show any interest in your business. As a result, you spend less while enjoying better results.

### It Acts as a Business Security

Starting a company with lead generation means your business planning isn’t temporary. It makes it easy to expand on a vast scale, thus offering a long-lasting reputation in the market.

### Helps Collect Essential Information about Prospects

Lead generation can collect vital marketing information, like the needs and preferences of potential customers. As such, you can tailor the value of your products to meet their interest and wants. A company can get this information through registration forms.

### Get a Better Return on Investment (ROI)

Higher ROI means you’re paying less for positive results. The best thing is that your businesses won’t be wasting money on people who aren’t interested in your brand.

## What is the Lead Generation Process?

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Emytw5lA0kyRgCd0r0Yzmtam6l7s5yJ3E5rHY_Q8LhiuwuIWsss5ij5krqkL8elhdFw0sMi261m_AWiJM4xUFCAarUkgfqRi9nG1WT4Hfv4OWYy3nRYl8yvemhYrMFX5MuGYlmEt)

Lead generation sounds easy in theory, but it’s a challenging practice for any business without an effective process.

What separates mid-range marketers from the pros? Here’s a 5-step procedure you can apply to have a winning edge over your competitors.

### Step 1: Define Your Goal and Objectives

Successful businesses set goals because, without them, you have nothing to strive for and no defined purpose. As such, the first step to an effective lead generation process is understanding and setting your objectives based on what you’d like to achieve.

Discuss with a specialized sales team your typical prospects’ buying stages and cycles. By doing so, you can determine the number of leads you want to achieve, sales goals, and revenue.

### Step 2: Research Your Target Market

Once you understand the needs and preferences of your potential customers, creating content that will attract them becomes easy.

Start by looking at your company’s website analytics to extract plenty of demographic data.

You’ll need to figure out why certain people are interested in your products or services by digging deeper into their fears, deep-seated pains, and needs.

There’s a lot of research in this step, and it requires a bit of creativity.

Allow your customer support and sales team to provide insights on different customers to help you generate better leads repeatedly.

### Step 3: Create Simplified Content

The marketing competition is high, so potential customers are doing you a favor by sparing a minute or two at your website.

At the same time, don’t forget to implement catchy titles and trending keywords.

The tone of your content is a critical factor in this step. 

Rather than being complicated, it should be friendly and relatable to ensure you gain your prospects’ trust.

Startups can use straightforward lead generation tactics like social media marketing and emails before working their way to expensive methods like in-person meetings.

### Step 4: Develop a Response Process

Decide how you intend to attract, measure, and respond to leads.

Determine whether you’ll direct responders to an email address, dedicated web page, phone number, or personalized web page.

Once you set up a process, test it before the first campaign, and ensure your sales team is ready to provide instant responses.

### Step 5: Maintain a Lead Database

This process involves identifying leads that are worth nurturing and pursuing, plus those that aren’t valuable. 

To make this tactic effective, ensure your in-house list is up-to-date. This is something that is often overlooked and undervalued, but you can target better leads while evaluating existing ones with it.

## How to Generate Leads — Or Better Yet _Quality Leads_

Have you ever wondered why businesses with top-tier potential fail after a year or two after establishment?

Generating leads isn’t as easy as it sounds, meaning any promising company will fall without a stable lead-generating mechanism.

Here’s how you can generate quality leads to attract a stream of potential clients.

### Generate Leads with LinkedIn

LinkedIn is a natural place to start since the site is built for business owners and professionals. However, it requires a bit of finesse to get quality leads.

When signing up on LinkedIn, ensure you optimize your profile. It may seem basic, but prospects are likely to accept invitations from users with a profile picture, name, and title.

Additionally, always follow your leads to avoid missing out on a potential customer.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/mCDG7jYLDOijvqTbU4yN8Jvnd1RFZza5ZslmKqSQlXGDrwtclCF-cFBNhKedAB2dBbZQpJ2SMYvswF5q1FTY8_Abb_aQlvMucy8yQw4KRfvKntx3ch6h5D49ds_eyQHqXyJ5ydzX)

Want to leverage Linkedin to generate more leads & sales for your business? Of course you do. So check out our article on the best **[Linkedin Automation Tools](https://devinschumacher.com/linkedin-automation-tools/)** that can help you accelerate this process and kick your sales efforts into effortless overdrive.

### Guest Blogging

Here’s another handy method of getting more customers and connecting with prospects. 

When guest blogging, you [write blogs for businesses offering similar but different services while adding links to your content](https://devinschumacher.com/best/ai-writing-software/).

Once readers get directed to your business page, there’s a high chance of increasing brand awareness and generating new customers.

### Share Unique Content

You may have already heard the term "content is king." 

As a business owner, what you post determines the number of people you’ll attract to your page. Posting valuable content on your business page helps create more awareness and attract your targeted audience.

Don’t forget to incorporate the right keywords to make your website more visible.

### Advertise on Social Media Platforms

While LinkedIn is a great platform, you can’t ignore the tremendous growth in Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.

For instance, in the first quarter of 2021, Facebook had around 2.5 billion monthly active users, making it the most prominent social network.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/NBZyGpKG7fz4o3pVekTysPZIb2IDYd2NN34Cct9F-DoOSqLv6OghlH4JkGzVhEB48W3lM1oGC247L1vS2I8bZTI-NHTXDRNIC026bHgMbldaI1WMgHOYJlROQqaaCq4qATS6Z8lZ)

Imagine how many quality leads your business would attract with the attention of only 10 percent of these users.

Better yet, treat social media pages like your websites by uploading professional photos, updating your news feed regularly, and using a clear call to action.

You can also run ads on various platforms to get effective results.

## How to Brainstorm Effective Lead Generation Strategies

Success proves difficult if you’re not attracting new customers, driving interest in your products, and establishing brand awareness.

However, consistently adjusting your lead generation strategies results in tremendous growth in your company.

Here’s a breakdown of lead generation strategies that businesses of all kinds can use.

### Publish Excellent Content

Investing in high-quality content is a reliable lead generation strategy since you earn your audience’s attention rather than buying it.

Producing premium content, answering who, why, where, and what your company has expertise in makes it easy for [search engines](https://devinschumacher.com/search-engines/) to reward you quickly.

Since searches are becoming increasingly local, you can tie your content into your physical location to dominate local online marketing.

### Focus on Keywords for Better SEO Results

Despite featuring a well-designed website, some businesses publish content without a perfect [SEO](https://devinschumacher.com/seo/) strategy.

For the best [lead generation](https://devinschumacher.com/lead-generation-strategies/) results, ensure you identify the most crucial keywords in your niche and location.

Do a thorough keyword search to have the ideal balance between high traffic and low competition.

By doing this, you’ll ensure that your website answers frequently answered questions, has clear and concise writing and provides vital information.

### Get Creative with Social Media Platforms

Using social media organically is one of the best lead generation strategies, especially for startups in local markets. At the same, though, you have to be creative to improve your business performance. 

Precisely why we highly recommend investing in paid [social media marketing](https://devinschumacher.com/what-is-social-media-marketing/). Not only does it have a greater reach than organic posts, but it is also relatively inexpensive.

With paid ad solutions, you can use Facebook or Instagram to target specific audiences or people who have linked with your business before.

Additionally, you can establish relationships with several influencers to help bring attention to your company.

### Give Realistic Offers

To date, this is one of the most effective lead generation strategies. However, make sure you offer something interesting and unique to attract and make your visitors feel valued. For instance, you can provide free consultation once in a while if you’re a plastic surgeon or divorce attorney.

## What are the Common Challenges of Lead Generation

Now that we have discussed effective lead generation strategies, you should also know how to overcome common obstacles when prospecting.

Below are some common challenges you’ll face with lead generation.

### Putting a Plan Together

Coming up with an effective plan is sometimes more complicated than generating the leads themselves. There are various content channels and social media platforms, so knowing your market proves difficult when starting.

While a business can use social media platforms for free, targeting a wider audience comes at a hefty cost.

Small companies may be forced to consult a marketing manager when conducting a plan, which isn’t cheap.

### Measuring Lead Generation Success

Some industries take months to close deals, meaning a lot happens during this process.

Besides, brand awareness and presence take time, so many business owners may give up.

Additionally, some small companies may have many leads but cannot give them enough attention since they don’t have access to a vast amount of resources.

### Get Minimal Attention

While getting the right leads is a top priority, pinning down the right audience is hard, especially if you lack a versatile plan. Mostly, this happens when you don’t have a deep understanding of the target audience.

### Hiring and Equipping the Right Salespeople

Sometimes a company fails to provide its sales team with the correct script on how to ask and answer the right questions plus overcome rejections.

Once potential customers feel like questions aren’t answered to their satisfaction, you’re likely to lose them to your competitors.
