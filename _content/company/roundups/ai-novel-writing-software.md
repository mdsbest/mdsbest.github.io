When the words just won't come out, Write can help!

Write is like supercharged autocomplete. It takes your characters, tone, and plot arc into account and generates the next 300 words in your voice. It even provides you with options!

### Descriptions that paint a mental picture without slowing down the story.

Writing can feel flat if you only focus on action and dialogue. Describe makes it easy to help your readers connect to your characters and feel like they're really "there".

No matter how much time you put into planning, some sections will feel rushed. Expand magically expands your scenes so that the pacing does not pull readers out of the story.

## FAQs

### Can AI Write entire novels yet?

It is difficult to answer whether or not artificial intelligence can write a novel. It is not only about being able to generate text, but also about being able to generate compelling and engaging plots.

[AI writing software](https://devinschumacher.com/best/ai-writing-software/) is still in its infancy, and it is difficult for them to create engaging plots, which is why writing novels is so difficult. However, there have been some successful applications of AI writing software, such as creating content for an online course.

Some may believe that the novel's quality will be lower than if it were written by a human, but this is not always the case. There are numerous examples of novels written by AI that have received positive feedback from readers.

That may appear frightening at first. It's easy to believe that AI will take your job. But consider this: just because AI is doing the tasks you used to do, does that mean you can't do anything else? Did you enjoy those tasks?

### How can AI assist you in writing a book?

Artificial intelligence, in my opinion, can be used effectively as a tool to help overcome writer's block, produce professionally written content, and publish faster.

It is a difficult task to write a book. It takes time, commitment, and effort. The process of writing a novel is made easier by AI writing software. You can use artificial intelligence as novel writing software to generate content ideas at scale and overcome writer's block. It can also be used to edit your novel and make it more reader-friendly.

There is no true complete book authoring software, but there are many tools to assist you!

The main benefit of using AI novel writing software is that it frees up your time, allowing you to focus on other tasks while the software does all of the work for you.

But make sure you [use a tool like Originality AI to make sure your content isn't reading like it was written by AI.](https://devinschumacher.com/reviews/originality-ai/)
