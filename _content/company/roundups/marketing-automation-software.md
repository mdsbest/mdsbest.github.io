## Features for Choosing The Right Marketing Automation Software

### Automation

Marketing automation solutions are part of a bigger marketing software platform. They enable you to create portal system sequences to complete several tasks. So how is this used in marketing? Itâ€™s largely built on email advertising, but there are lots of social media advertisements and Telemarketing too. It all comes with processes.

### Workflows

To better understand processes, let's look at an example:

As a starting point, consider sending out an ad to all of the people who have liked your Facebook page. Automated workflows begin when someone clicks on an advertisement. Sending an e-mail to a page where customers can see products specifically selected for you based on their previous online behavior is one way to do this.

Alternatively, another branching of the automated chain may do something different, such as sending a promotion email to individuals who saw the ad but do not read the email. You don't have to do anything to make it happen. Only at crucial points should you become engaged. Templates for workflows are common in good marketing automation solutions.

Using a visual dashboard, you may also make changes to them. If-Then logic appears to be growing a tree, with either-or branches. You may simply block off these operations using drag and drop.

### Segmentation

Audience segmentation is a helpful technique as well. It is possible to automate the process of classifying all of your contacts according to numerous categories. Information gleaned from profiles or social media sites, as well as data stored in your database, is used to make these determinations about them. The segments can also be edited and new tags and groups can be added.

This improves the marketing automation platform's capacity to personalize content for each contact. For instance, an online sports store can use different background images depending on the customer's purchasing history while sending out an email newsletter to all of its subscribers. Segmentation can also be done based on demographics, the type of device they use, or their geolocations, for example.

### Predictive Analytics

It's possible to employ marketing automation systems for predictive functions as well. All the activities in your ad interactions or funnels may be viewed through this tool. It may optimize a wide range of marketing decisions based on information about your successes and failures.

Some examples of this include the most effective times of day to publish an ad or e-mail, etc. It also provides lead scoring, which tells you how likely a potential customer is to interact or make a transaction.

The lubricant that connects the marketing and advertising pipelines, you might say, is marketing automation software. New consumers may be found and nurtured by using this method.
