Want to conceal your internet activity more discreetly? To protect your privacy and allow you to visit prohibited websites, proxy services can mask your IP address.

This article reviews five of the top proxy servers currently available. The finest proxy servers may be used for both private and professional purposes.

## What is a proxy server?

A proxy server is a piece of software or a network service that facilitates the sending of requests from one computer to another. The client (your computer, for instance) seeks access to a service (such as a website) and the proxy server mediates the connection between the client and the service.

**The following diagram illustrates conceptually how direct data exchange and data exchange via proxy server might take place between two machines on a network:**

## Why do we need proxy servers?

Proxy servers are now mostly used to mask or alter an Internet Protocol address before visiting a website. Many other motivations exist for doing so.

**To start, let's think about the most prevalent ones:**

### Web surfing with complete anonymity

To avoid having your true Internet Protocol (IP) address revealed when engaging in activities like online browsing, file downloading, forum posting, emailing, and using instant messaging services, you may make use of a proxy server that is anonymous, elite, or distorting.

### When trying to connect to a site that has a cap on the number of simultaneous connections or requests you may make in a certain period

Many file-sharing platforms restrict how many downloads may occur from a single IP address in a given time. Due to the high prevalence of dynamic IP addresses service's download cap may have already been reached at the IP address you have been assigned.

A proxy server can be used to resolve the issue. Also, when dealing with services that have request caps, proxies might be a helpful workaround.

### Verifying that users from all around the world can reach the site

Check the site's accessibility from locations with varying Internet service providers and networks by connecting using a proxy server.

### Online security being evaded

Proxy servers allow users to bypass network restrictions and gain access to otherwise inaccessible websites. For instance, if the service blocks access based on the user's IP address or the IP addresses of an entire country.

If the user's Internet service provider blocks the site, that's a plus, too. In China, for instance, several widely used web apps like Gmail, Instagram, Twitter, etc. are unavailable to users. Users in China can circumvent this restriction by connecting to these sites using proxy servers in other countries.

## Conclusion

Proxy servers can see your true IP address and the details of your unencrypted web request. Because of this, it is important to make sure the proxy server you use stores logs and records your data. Data stored on the server has to be encrypted.

Selecting a proxy server that doesn't record your IP address is highly advised. When deciding on a server, you must research their rules on data retention and cooperation with law authorities.

Because they don't have to pay for expensive server hardware or encryption, free proxy servers present a security risk. There is a risk that using a service because it is free will compromise the privacy and security of your data. The privacy and ease of use of paid services much surpass those of their free counterparts.
