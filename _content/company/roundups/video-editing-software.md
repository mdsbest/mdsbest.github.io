## Is Video Content Overrated?

Video is not the holy grail of [SEO](https://devinschumacher.com/seo/). Embedding a video won’t make your badly formatted and unedited blog post [rank sky-high](https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/). 

That’s not to say that video content isn’t great for SEO. People stay longer on your page when you embed eye-catching YouTube videos. Besides, video content is 50 times more likely to rank organically than text.

But the real benefit of the video format is that you can get the message across directly.

That's why video is the most popular format of high-impact content on social media.

No lengthy explanations are needed. Videos engage multiple senses to help us communicate as naturally as possible. We are visual creatures, after all.

Besides, perhaps, face-to-face contact, video is still an unmatched communication channel.

## Reviews Of The Best Video Editing Software From Our Research

### [Adobe Premiere Elements](https://serp.ly/adobe-premiere-elements/)

![](/images/adobe-premiere-elments-1024x488.png)

**Adobe Premiere Elements comes in 1st place as the leading video editor on the market**. You'll be able to edit videos seamlessly with the help of its artificial intelligence which speeds up the entire process. Its video editing features are absolutely amazing and easy to use.

For instance, artificial intelligence is present in the Guided Edits capability; beginner filmmakers and editors will have a much easier time learning the ropes from the beginning of the editing process to the end.

4K resolution support and cross-platform usage cement this video editor as one of the best. **Other features include video stabilization, subject selection & selective edits, real-time effect application,** and more.

Unfortunately, 360-degree video editing is still not present, as is true for multi-cam support as well. Nonetheless, even if it's not the most advanced video editing program, it's still **packed with features that are friendly towards both beginners and professional editors**. This software will set you back $99.99 which might be slightly expensive for absolute beginners.

#### **Features:**

- $99.99

- 30-day free trial

- Available on Windows and Mac

- Video stabilization

- Motion tracking (automatic)

- Face detection

- 4K support

#### **Pros:**

- Easy to learn and use

- Plenty of features

- Has artificial intelligence

- Video stabilization and 4K support come in very handy

#### **Cons:**

- No VR support

- No 360-degree cam support

- No multi-cam support

- Slightly slower than other video editing software

- Not as powerful as others

### [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://serp.ly/adobe-premiere-pro/)

**Adobe's Premiere Pro enables users to take the next step in editing videos**. Almost all of the professionals in the industry use Premiere Pro due to its extensive features list and capabilities. This piece of software supports many different video formats that are quite often used in various applications such as YouTube clips and videos, promotional cuts, and short movies.

The app, although oriented towards professionals, can still be used by amateurs due to its ingenious user interface. Additionally, **Premiere Pro supports 4K and 8K resolutions, VR formats, and an infinite number of video tracks**. The video file you import can be divided into separate video and audio tracks, which can further be trimmed and edited with Premiere Pro's powerful tools.

Lastly, the software lets you customize keyboard shortcuts for a personalized experience. The largest downside of Premiere Pro is that it costs $20.99 per month. A **subscription payment system is not ideal, especially for amateur video editors**.

Although, from a different perspective, the price is justified for what you get to make a nicely edited video.

#### **Features:**

- $20.99/month

- 7-day free trial

- Available on Windows and Mac

- Multi-cam editing

- 3D Editing

- H.265 exporting format

- 360-degree support

- 4K and 8K support

#### **Pros:**

- Standardized software for the industry

- Integration with Adobe Creative Cloud

- Exceptional number of features and abilities

- 3D and multi-cam editing are great

- 360-degree support is a game-changer

#### **Cons:**

- Subscription-based payment

- No motion tracking

### [Pinnacle Studio](https://serp.ly/pinnacle-studio/)

Pinnacle Studio is made by the same people who created VideoStudio Ultimate - the Corel company. They've had their hands in the media and graphics industry for a while, so it **shouldn't be surprising that this software is one of the best choices you can make**.

Coming in at an impressive $127 for the Ultimate Edition (which has thousands of effects, templates, and titles), Pinnacle Studio might sound expensive but the price is well justified. **One of the most feature-packed video editing tools you can find**, it might be a shock to learn that it is super simple to use and generally oriented towards novice videographers!

Finding the right video editing software is made easier with the existence of Pinnacle. The ultimate version comes with some stunning functionalities such as **color correction tools, stop motion animation, 8K importing ability, grouping keyframes, various blending modes, audio tools**, and more.

Although Pinnacle Studio doesn't have a free version and no free trial, the Standard Edition is still a great purchase to test the software out. You also get a 30-day money-back guarantee so if you ultimately don't like it, you can get your money back. Overall, using this video editing software feels like a breeze... Which might not be enough for the experienced professional video editor. **There's no Mac support either - Windows only**.

#### **Features (Ultimate version):**

- $63.5 (Standard version), $104 (Plus version), $127 (Ultimate version

- 30-day money-back guarantee

- Works on Windows

- Stop motion animation

- Multi-cam capture

- 360-degree video editing

#### **Pros:**

- Fast

- Variety of useful features

- Free templates, effects, and titles

- Easy to use

#### **Cons:**

- Lack of Mac support

- Somewhat basic

- Sometimes buggy

### [Apple Final Cut Pro](https://serp.ly/apple-final-cut-pro/)

Although costing a high $299.99 for lifetime access, it's better than paying a monthly subscription for use. **The Apple Final Cut Pro is a highly respected and optimized piece of software** for Mac users and as such, it's the best you can get (on Mac). However, this is also a negative; Windows users cannot use it and that limits the number of people that can utilize it, which in turn drives the price upwards.

Nonetheless, Apple offers a **90-day trial for the Final Cut Pro** which is more than generous to explore and experience all of it. It's great for both beginners and professionals; the user interface is neatly organized and accessing the software's features is quick and seamless.

Integration works similarly to Adobe's products; **the Final Cut Pro goes well with Apple Photos or iTunes**. Boasting an intelligent magnetic timeline, a vast number of video effects, grouping tools, and an innovative system to edit and add audio, the Final Cut Pro can easily further your video editing career.

Lastly, I'd like to mention an unusual but amazing tidbit of info about the Final Cut Pro - **automatic and free updates**. Usually, software that is not subscription-based doesn't come with auto-updates but Apple decided to take a unique approach.

#### **Features:**

- $299.99

- 90-day free trial

- Available on Mac

- Advanced color balancing

- Multi-cam edit support

- 4K & 360-degree support

#### **Pros:**

- The 3-month free trial is very generous

- Powerful and packed with features

- Intuitive user interface enables ease of access to all features

- Perfectly optimized for Macs

- Better than other video editors for Mac

#### **Cons:**

- Very expensive

- Available only on Mac

- Motion tracking & stabilization non-existent for 360-degree video

- Video timeline might be confusing to those who are used to a traditional design

### [Nero Video](https://serp.ly/nero-video/)

Nero Video is definitely the **cheapest video editor on our list**. It's also the skimpiest of the lot. Beginners and slightly advanced videographers will find it useful and a perfect step to learn more. But nothing more than that.

So if you're interested in testing out your skills and learning a couple of new ones, paying $47.95 is a great investment. With all of that said, it still **comes with 4K video support and H.265 file format support** which is a big plus for one of the more basic software.

It comes with a wide variety of video effects and some templates, as well as the ability to edit audio. Nero Video is fairly quick with processing the end result after you edit videos. Unfortunately, its interface leaves more to be desired as it feels outdated and old. It's also used in a different way than other interfaces and not in a positive way.

Still, for such a cheap price, **Nero Video is an impressive video editing software** - plus you get 15 days free trial to test out the software before purchase.

#### **Features:**

- $47.95

- 15-day free trial

- Vertical video support

- Royalty-free sounds

- 4K video support

- H.265 support

#### **Pros:**

- Very affordable

- Free software version lasts 15 days

- Impressive number of video effects

- Some audio tools and effects available

#### **Cons:**

- Doesn't have a lot of features

- No motion tracking support

- No 360-degree or 3D video support

- Inability to export videos to social media

- Dated user interface

## Buyer's Guide For Video Editing Software

Before opting for any of the best video editors, you need to take some time to analyze what exactly you want to do. Some software is better than others in some regards but overall, all of them serve the same purpose. It's the smaller details that make a huge difference.

### Supported Video Formats

Some of the most common video formats include MP4, AVI, and MKV. But these just scratch the surface of what kinds of video formats exist. You should also take a look at which audio formats the software supports although, in general, all the major audio formats are supported by most video editing apps.

For example, you would seldom need MKV since this format combines video, audio, and subtitles in one file. That is if you don't dabble with promotional videos for movies or shows. **Always make sure to check what formats your chosen video editor** supports and make a choice according to that.

### Ease of Use

Depending on your skill set and experience levels, some video editing tools will feel lackluster and unable to fulfill your requirements. With that said, if you've just started video editing and are looking for some simple-to-use software, a video editor with fewer features but a great UI should be more than enough for you.

### Effects

Using video effects to create videos, edit them, and submit the final cut is arguably the most interesting and fun activity you'll do from beginning to end. Having the ability to create custom video masks and apply video filters, creating a work-of-art, is what most video editors desire.

**Adobe Premiere**, for example, **is jam-packed with features and effects that the user can apply to any video clip from their video library**. But does this mean it's the best video editor out there? Absolutely not! The number of effects doesn't determine how good a software is, but it does signal potential users about what they will get with the software.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Video Editing Software

### Is free video editing software any good?

A free video editor is just as good as paid ones, albeit not if you're in need of some of the most advanced features. Imagine a comparison between Adobe Photoshop and the GIMP software; GIMP is free and perfectly capable of fulfilling all needs [graphic design software](https://devinschumacher.com/graphic-design-software/) should have.

This is slightly different with video editing software as there aren't nearly as many free choices as there are paid ones. But **one great free video editor is the Apple iMovie tool**; free on the Apple website but slightly lagging behind a paid video editing tool (like the Final Cut Pro). Still, it's great for beginners and those that want to dip their fit in the video editing business.

### How to choose the best video editing software for yourself?

That all depends on what you want from video editing. Some video editors are easier to use than others with arguably a similar number of features. Others are complicated and oriented towards professional video content and high-quality videos.

For starters, it might be best to choose a video editor that isn't too far-fetched as far as your capabilities are concerned. Starting off with home videos and a personal video project is perfect if you need some experience or want to try something new.

Otherwise, paid video software should be your primary choice for creating specialized, high-quality video files.

### Is 4K or 8K support necessary for video editing?

Unless you are dealing with some advanced video clips and your client (or yourself) needs top-quality video footage, video effects, audio effects, and more - then 4K or 8K support should not be your worry. Still, it's very nice to have so if your long-term goals require such high video quality, then by all means go for a video editor capable of importing and exporting 4K or 8K video tracks.

## Final Thoughts

**Creating mesmerizing videos with epic background music wouldn't be possible without capable software and an experienced video editor at the helm**. These video and audio tools are what enable even the wildest of ideas to come to life.

But with the vast number of available ones, choosing the video editor that fits your style and needs can become complicated. This is why this guide will set you on the road to making the best decision for your video editing career.

![This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is best-video-editing-software-gif-4.gif](/images/best-video-editing-software-gif-4.gif)

Whether you choose the best overall software in the form of Adobe Premiere Pro or a fast and beautiful one like the Pinnacle Studio - you can be sure that you've made the right choice. After all, **the tools at your hand define the extent of what your possibilities are**.

If you want to create video content yourself, you need to jump headfirst into the creative sea of video editing. Of course, the essential tools you’ll need are a camera and software to edit videos with.

### Is Video Editing Difficult To Learn?

Even the most user-friendly video editing tool can be intimidating to a beginner.

These intricate programs come with plenty of buttons and sliders to play with. But that can make for a steep learning curve. Reaching the exact results you brainstormed earlier will be hard until you get to know the software in depth.

Which video editing software is best for beginners? There are many beginner-friendly video editors out there. iOS and macOS users may enjoy iMovie, and VSDC is a free video editing program available to Windows users. But really, any good editing program will do!

Approach learning how to use the program step-by-step. Learn the basic functions first – things like changing the length and the aspect ratio of your video and adding subtitles. Don't stress over advanced features like motion tracking and 360-degree video editing in the beginning - you'll have time for that once you master the basic editing tools.

And don’t worry if you get stuck and don’t know what to do next – you can find plenty of video editor software tutorials and advice on YouTube.

### What Are The Must-Have Features In A Video Editor?

With the expansion of digital commerce, video editing software became widely accessible. As a result, the technology was no longer reserved for big movie studios and art universities.

Today, consumer video editing software comes with both basic and advanced features like:

**Cutting segments** **of video clips and joining them together** **in whatever sequence you want**

Computer programs like Adobe Premiere Pro and Apple Final Cut Pro are also known as non-linear editors (NLE). With an NLE, you have the ability to change whichever part of the video you want, whenever you want. With the beginner-friendly programs, changing the order of your footage is easy with a drag-and-drop interface.

#### **Special Effects and Animated Transitions**

Rich transition galleries (cross-fades, cuts, fades to black, etc.) include all kinds of effects that can make your story flow smoothly.

#### **Add Titles and Subtitles**

You’ll reach a wider audience and help people understand you the way you intended.

#### **Color Grading**

Change the colors in your videos to set the mood just the way you want it. Many programs contain easy-to-use tools like color wheels, hue sliders, and eye-catching filters.

#### **Green Screen**

Otherwise known as chroma key, it will let you film in Hawaii, outer space, or a neat studio straight from your living room. 

#### **Several Output Formats**

It lets you balance the size and quality of your video files; 4k video support is a big bonus.

## The Best Video Editing Software on the Market

### [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://serp.ly/adobe-premiere-pro/) - The Professionals’ Choice, MAC, and Windows

Adobe was a pioneer in the field of computer graphics. To this day, the company sets standards among [image](https://devinschumacher.com/free-photo-management-software/) and video manipulation software solutions.

When it comes to post-production video editing software, Adobe Premiere Pro is the golden standard – and has been since 1991.

**Features**

Available to Windows, Linux, and Mac users, Premiere Pro has everything you might ever need.

From powerful hardware acceleration, a huge library of transitions and special effects, to intricate tools like an audio mixer, **Premiere Pro has it all**.

Its huge variety of precision tools will give you complete control over your video. If the program doesn’t have exactly what you need, chances are there’s a plug-in for it.  

Chock-full with features, Adobe programs can be intimidating to beginners. But they’re worth the effort – the more experience you have with Premiere Pro, the more powerful the program will become. If you intend to edit videos for the long run, learning Premiere Pro is a great long-term decision.

You can even adapt it to your habits as you go with fully customizable keyboard shortcuts.

Premiere Pro comes with all the advanced features pro movie studios use, including motion tracking, multi-cam, and 3D editing. The program even supports 4K, 8K, and VR formats.

**Pricing**

However, it doesn’t come free. After a 30-day free trial, you’ll need to purchase a monthly subscription or an annual plan. Adobe products are top of the line, so they come with a relatively hefty price tag. Check out their product packages, though – you may find a great deal if you get a few products at once.

### Free Beginner Editing Software for MAC and iOS - [iMovie](https://serp.ly/imovie/)

Both iOS and macOS users can find one of the best video editing programs pre-installed on their Apple devices.

iMovie is an amazing choice of video editing software for beginners. This intuitive video editor is straightforward to use – and rocks the simplest drag-and-drop interface among our picks.

**Features**

However, its simplicity and the fact it’s free comes at a price. That’s why Apple iMovie lacks some of the advanced options of other programs. For example, you won’t be able to do video masking or create animated intros.

Still, all of your footage will be neatly organized and seamlessly joined, coupled with lovely music, color transitions, and effects, and exported in up to 4K quality.

Along with other basic functions like titles and slideshow transitions, iMovie's intuitive interface supports some advanced functionalities too. For example, you can use a chroma key – the ability to transport you anywhere in the world with only a green sheet behind you.

The fact that you can use this editor on all of your Apple devices makes it easy to prepare footage and trim the excess on the go. Then, once you’re in front of your computer, you can perform detailed post-production without wasting time.

**Pricing**

Apple iMovie is completely free – for as long as you have an Apple device to use it on. In fact, the chances are that iMovie is already installed on your iPad or Mac computer.

### A Professional Video Editor for MAC users - [Final Cut Pro](https://serp.ly/final-cut-pro/)

People who do video editing professionally usually opt for Adobe’s Premiere Pro or Apple’s Final Cut Pro. While you can use Premiere Pro on a Mac, Final Cut is the more popular choice among Mac users. This comes with a few advantages – an intuitive interface, faster rendering, and a somewhat lower price tag.

Besides, Apple Final Cut Pro X is the natural next step for people who outgrow iMovie.

**Features**

The most recent edition of the program, Final Cut Pro X is rich with basic and pro features.  

The interface is based on the magnetic timeline – Final Cut’s unique timeline can be expanded or simplified into a single-track storyline for less advanced users.

When it comes to other features, Final Cut Pro X lacks nothing. It comes with advanced options like multi-cam editing and intelligent color balance adjustments. In addition, once you start exporting your video, your computer won’t be locked in place – you can even continue using the program while it’s exporting.

Overall, Final Cut Pro X is an advanced video editing program that most Mac users will enjoy!

**Pricing**

Final Cut Pro X doesn’t come for free – but it only requires a single payment of $299.99 and you can use the program forever. If you’re not sure whether this program is a good choice for you, check out its 90-day free trial!

### Pro-like Freemium Software for MAC and Windows - [DaVinci Resolve](https://serp.ly/davinci-resolve/)

Video editors from the DaVinci Resolve product line can be found in amateurs’ homes and professional movie studios worldwide. So what sets this program apart?

Well, for one, you can run it on any operating system: Windows, Mac, or Linux.

**Features**

What started as a color correction tool today is a super-powerful, all-encompassing video editing software. With all the little features you could want, DaVinci Resolve is becoming more and more popular among users.

DaVinci Resolve has anything an amateur video editor will ever need from timeline editing, rich transition and effects galleries, outstanding color grading, and intricate audio editing tools. Including rich libraries with hundreds of titles, transitions, and effects. As a bonus – you can use pre-made or set up your own keyboard shortcuts.

Divided into “pages”, this program gives you a dedicated workspace with tools ideal for particular process steps in video editing. While that takes some getting used to, the DaVinci Resolve interface quickly becomes like second nature – it’s completely logical once you delve into it.

The biggest disadvantage of this program is you’ll need a powerful computer to run it. Unfortunately, DaVinci Resolve is not suitable for slow PCs.

However, people with two screens rejoice – DaVinci Resolve neatly divides its workspace between dual monitors.

**Pricing**

The best part – unless you need really advanced features, you can use DaVinci Resolve completely free of charge!

Get yourself acquainted with this program, and if you decide you want more, you can get the pro version called DaVinci Resolve Studio for a one-time payment of $299. The Pro version brings you export resolutions higher than Ultra HD, frame rates higher than 60 FPS, and additional plugins and effects like motion blur.

### The Best Free Video Editing Software for Windows - [VSDC Free Video Editor](https://serp.ly/vsdc-free-video-editor/)

It’s not hard to find good video editing software for Windows – but it is a challenge to find a decent program that can run on weaker PCs, and completely free of charge at that!

VSDC has it all – it’s readily available and completely amazing!

**Features**

We were surprised by how lightweight this program is, considering all of the features it brings to the table! You can run it on a PC with as little as 2 GB of RAM – and encounter no issues.

It boasts almost everything that expensive programs have:

- Most popular video, image, and audio formats supported

- Large library of video effects, customizable filters, and transitions

-  An advanced color correction toolset

- Tools like zoom, charts, and 360 video editing

- Powerful green screen function – and your screen doesn’t necessarily need to be green

- Various export formats and profiles.

It’s an amazing tool for advanced video editing and basic functions like audio improvement, creating voiceovers, capturing your screen, and more.

**Pricing**

The basic version of VSDC is completely free and contains all features a beginner may want.

If you feel that the free version of VSDC doesn’t have everything you need, consider the Pro version for $20/year – which is significantly cheaper than any other paid video editing software on the market. In addition, the Pro version brings you video masking, motion tracking, syncing video effects to the rhythm of music, hardware acceleration, and editing your audio through a waveform.

## Tips For Making Great Video Montages

### Keep Your Footage Organized

Messy files are a common source of frustration for people who do video editing. Even projects that start out simple usually end up with a bunch of additional files.

Keep this in mind – and act accordingly.

Prepare your files in advance to keep your editing a smooth ride.

Trim the beginnings and ends of your scenes in advance, label your video and audio files, and keep them all organized in an easy-to-reach folder.

### From First Draft to Final Cut

All video editing software presented here falls under the category of **non-linear video editors**. That means they let you change whatever you want in a timeline. So whenever you add or remove a part of the footage, other parts adjust accordingly.

That means you have the freedom to play with arranging and rearranging parts in the video timeline. If you’re not exactly sure how you want your movie to go, experiment with rough drafts. 

Watch a few versions, go with what feels pleasant and logical, and refine your video as you go.

Once you’re happy with the flow of your video, adjust the sound and colors, and - voilà!

### Save Frequently

No matter how reliable your computer is, and no matter how confident you are with the power supply – **save often**. Even high-end programs like Adobe Premiere Pro sometimes crash.

Video editing tools manipulate large and complex files, and many processes happen at the same time. That’s why even the best video editing solutions sometimes crash.

Getting into the habit of clicking the save button every half-hour may pay off. Occasionally back up your files on the cloud. It’ll be worth it, even if a crash only happens _that one time_.

## That's a Wrap!

There are many video editing apps available on the market. They come with different sets of features and very variable price points, so it can be a tough choice - especially if you're after editing software for beginners.

Even though it can be a tough choice, there's great video editing software for everyone out there. Some people only want the basic tools like joining video clips, while others want to try out motion tracking, 360-degree video editing, and much more.

Here, we compiled a list of the best video editing software out there and pinpointed the exact benefits of using each specific program.

We hope you found exactly what you were looking for on our list and have fun with the creative video editing work!
