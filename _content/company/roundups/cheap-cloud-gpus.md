## Runpod

![Runpod-gpu](/images/runpod-gpu.png)

### Background

RunPod is on a quest to completely democratize AI. Our initial objective is to make cloud computing accessible to everyone at prices that are very low without compromising usability, experience, or functionality.

Secure Cloud and Community Cloud are the two cloud computing services that RunPod currently offers.

Our reliable partners operate Secure Cloud in T3/T4 data centers. Due to the close relationship between these, there is great reliability, as well as redundancy, security, and quick response times to reduce any downtimes.

RunPod strongly advises using Secure Cloud for any sensitive and business workloads.

Community Cloud offers strength in numbers and global diversity. They can supply peer-to-peer GPU computing, which links individual compute providers to consumers, through our decentralized platform.

They only accept Community Cloud providers by invitation after thoroughly vetting them to ensure that they deliver reliable computing.

Compared to major [cloud service](https://devinschumacher.com/best/cloud-storage-services/) providers like AWS or GCP, both alternatives offer costs that are much more affordable.

### Pricing

All charges, including compute and storage per hour invoicing, are made per minute.

#### How is RunPod billing carried out?

Based on the type of GPU, each pod has an hourly price. For as long as the pod is operating, you get billed for the compute every minute. The cost will be deducted from your RunPod credits.

Your pods will be immediately halted and you will receive an email if you ever run out of credits.

Eventually, if you don't top off your credit, pods will be shut down.

#### How is storage billing carried out?

Currently, we charge $0.1 per gigabyte per month for all storage on active pods and $0.2 per gigabyte per month for volume storage on stopped pods.

RunPod want to make sure that active users have enough space to run their workloads because storage is linked to compute servers.

They will never charge users if the host computer is down or inaccessible over the open internet because storage is charged on a per-minute basis.

### Instances

#### What exactly is an instance on demand?

Non-interruptible workloads are appropriate for on-demand instances. As long as you have enough money to keep your pod running, you pay the on-demand pricing and are not subject to competition from other customers.

#### What exactly is a spot instance?

An interruptible instance called a spot instance can typically be rented for a lot less money than an on-demand instance.

Spot instances are excellent for stateless workloads, such as APIs, or for workloads that may be saved to volume storage on a recurring basis. If your spot instance is interrupted, your volume disk is still kept.

### Support

RunPod is happy to help! Join their community on discord, message them in our support chat, or send an email to support@runpod.io!

Very easy to get in contact with and recommend using RunPod as your [Cloud GPU provider](https://serp.ai/cloud-gpus/).

## Lambda GPU Cloud

![Lambda](/images/lambda.png)

### Background

The majority of my work in AI and machine learning is done when I'm a student, but occasionally I have personal projects that call for me to rent a computer that is more advanced than my laptop for school.

Lambda Labs appeals to me since it's less expensive than renting equipment from Amazon, Google, or Microsoft.

### Pricing

A 4-GPU instance costs an absurdly cheap $1.50 per hour. The strange amount of RAM (11GB) and the Pascal-based GPUs are very clear indicators that we're most likely dealing with NVIDIA 1080 TIs.

Additionally, the 8-GPU V100 instance costs only $12 per hour, outpacing Amazon by a considerable amount.

### Instances

The process of starting an instance sign-up was quite simple. I had to provide my SSH keys after logging in because they only support public-key authentication for their instances. After that, I can choose from one of five possibilities by clicking "Launch Instance."

To my disappointment, the first RTX 6000-based one that I was anxious to try did not succeed in launching the instance.

The 2x/4x RTX 6000 was my next test. same mistake At this point, I speculated that perhaps their RTX 6000 systems were just fully utilized. I attempted the robust 8x V100 they so enthusiastically promoted on their home page, but I received the same issue. The issue persisted when I tried several times during the day and the day after.

Finally, the only option available to me was the Legacy-branded 1080 Ti, which, in all honesty, was too old-fashioned for any of the models I use. That was a little discouraging, but I kept going.

### Support

After attempting to create other instances for a day without success (I just believed that perhaps they were inaccessible or something), I made the decision to try their help.

Since it occupies a sizable portion of the screen and frequently interferes with basic dashboard navigation, it is quite simple to locate.

They'll respond tomorrow, according to the status, as it's becoming late here. It's alright. My message is typed.

When I press submit, a loading circle that never ends appears. Again, I try. Still have the same problem.

For how intrusive their help window is, communicating with them is pretty challenging!

## DataCrunch.io

![Datacrunch](/images/datacrunch.png)

### Background

Helsinki, Finland, is where DataCrunch was established. Southern Finland is where they house our infrastructure.

They have a direct connection to Germany via the C-Lion1 submarine cable, which links them to continental Europe.

## CoreWeave

![Coreweave](/images/coreweave.png)

### Background

Enterprise scale GPU-accelerated applications are catered for by CoreWeave, a dedicated cloud service provider.

For compute-intensive use cases like machine learning, VFX rendering, Pixel Streaming, and batch processing, their Kubernetes-native infrastructure is specifically designed and up to 35x quicker and 80% less expensive than legacy cloud providers.

CoreWeave Cloud was specifically designed to offer the greatest performance for each workload.

The infrastructure is built on the most comprehensive collection of high-end NVIDIA GPUs in the market, but everything from their Kubernetes native cloud platform to their networking and server architecture will always beat traditional cloud providers.

### Pricing

Pricing for CoreWeave Cloud GPU instances is extremely flexible and designed to provide you complete control over both configuration and cost.

The a la carte pricing shown below combines the costs of a GPU component, the number of virtual CPUs, and the amount of RAM allotted to create the overall instance cost.

The GPU selected for your workload or Virtual Server is the only variable, keeping things straightforward. CPU and RAM costs are the same per base unit.

A GPU instance must have at least 1 GPU, 1 vCPU, and 2GB of RAM to be considered genuine. The GPU instance configuration must also have at least 40GB of root disk NVMe tier storage when a Virtual Server is deployed.

Plans start at $0.24/hour and max out at $2.21.

### Instances

Are there "spot" or interruptible instances available?T

They don't. Their on-demand pricing can be compared to "interruptible pricing for uninterruptible instances." When their clients spin up instances on CoreWeave Cloud, they can do so with confidence knowing that they will remain theirs until they choose to spin them down once their workloads are finished, thanks to pricing that enables them to scale.

### Support

CoreWeave does not have any official live chat or support number to call that we can find.

Instead, they use a contact form where you fill out your information on a form on their website and they will contact you back.

We would like to see a live support chat, but unfortunately this is not the case.

## LeaderGPU

![Leadergpu](/images/leadergpu.png)
