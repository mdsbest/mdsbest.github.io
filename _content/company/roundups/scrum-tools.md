Scrum is an agile development framework that allows you to effortlessly deal with complex adaptive issues inside a project. 

It ensures that handling such tasks doesn't happen at the expense of productivity and service or product delivery. With Scrum, a team is guaranteed to make strides in improving its output continuously. No kidding.

As a working structure, Scrum helps organizations generate value through the use of adaptive solutions. This means that complex problems are addressed and solved promptly. The most important attributes of Scrum include its accountabilities, artifacts, rules, and events that are injected into a project every time a team decides to use one of the tools.

Every Scrum needs a master who assumes the role of the team leader for the duration of the project. They are required to foster an environment that does the following:

- Manages and keeps track of a backlog
- Has a team ready to turn a selection into an increment
- Has subordinates that can inspect and adjust an order in preparation for a Sprint

Like other agile development tools, Scrum aids in boosting productivity and ensuring that the end customer continuously enjoys a superior product. In addition, there are other secondary benefits associated with the Scrum framework.

## Buyer’s Guide For Scrum Tools

### Why is Scrum Important Today?

Scrum derives its utility from modern business development concerns associated with the complexity of projects. Often, it is easy for a team to lose track of one of the key customer requirements for software, product, or service improvement. 

On the other hand, organizations that focus on such increments run the risk of failing to deliver regular output. In most cases, their efforts, time, and resources are held up in product improvement.

The Scrum framework introduces a working balance between regular business operations and product improvement. It helps organizations manage the tradeoff without sacrificing one aspect over the other.

The framework presents benefits for the following stakeholders:

- Customers
- Vendors
- Development teams
- Product managers
- Project managers
- C-Level executives

Scrum helps customers by ensuring that product vendors are continuously adding features that improve the end experience. This may be contrasted with the traditional approach, where improvements are delayed for years in preparation for an overhaul. 

Overall, the customer gets to enjoy quicker fixes and timely responses to complaints as they don't need to wait for a big upgrade sometime in the future. Faster development requests and implementation are critical since it keeps customer satisfaction high.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BF2XugydL9ajHXqUAV_09W_pn8D6EIvlyPPdtN-4QOsOB_CTYdGkJ7i8zbgjaxtP-QruOJzv1SDJorxoj-wNsohRf_eUh3bXbGOgr49uipHyoAfTQBbktUr9PMfmDvDXYo_7-Sbw)

The framework benefits the product vendors by allowing them to focus on creating high-quality features. This means that they don't have to keep repairing and patching up older legacy systems that are best discarded. 

Consequently, most of the development effort is directed at features that the customer needs.

Scrum also shortens the overall development time since the overheads and efficiency that the framework encourages don't require months or years of planning. Instead, changes are implemented as soon as the need to consider them arises.

This means that the backlog is continuously being addressed in the present. It also implies that the product is continuously improving without requiring the vendors to consider expensive capital injection for the customer.

By addressing problems as soon as they arise, the development team minimizes the time spent solving unnecessary glitches. 

For instance, it's unnecessary to spend time and resources patching up an older piece of software if the same benefits can be had by improving the overall product. However, the customer may not realize this since they don't have access to a company's development information.

Scrum helps project managers since they are responsible for ensuring that every major task is accomplished within the correct time frame, budget, and quality specifications. Scrum managers have to invest lots of time and effort balancing the three attributes under the traditional waterfall approach. 

However, Scrum helps them plan and track the execution and implementation of any project in a more streamlined fashion.

Remember, the stakes of managing a traditional project are higher since such undertakings are considered after a long time. Moreover, they are capital-intensive projects that attract a high level of risk in case of unforeseen challenges. 

With Scrum, the manager doesn't need to worry so much since continuous iterations allow them to make scope adjustments every few months. Moreover, Scrum doesn't attract high stakes as the budgetary overlay is often modest.

C-Level executives are considered to be part of the external stakeholders' group. One of their key demands during product development is transparency since they're answerable to the investors. Therefore, they need as much information as possible whenever they have to face the shareholders.

With Scrum, they get to observe and scrutinize intricate aspects of product development in a way that wouldn't be possible under the traditional method. This is because the scope of any Increment is often small enough to review and internalize.

With the benefits of this agile framework out of the way, it's necessary to analyze some of the leading Scrum tools.

## Final Thoughts

Agile project management and product development principles have become a necessity in modern businesses looking for transparency, flexibility, and reliable delivery. 

Tools such as Jira, ScrumDo, VivifyScrum, and others discussed above are critical in implementing the Scrum agile approach to project management.

One important feature offered by every Scrum implementation is support for self-organization. The framework allows teams to solve problems based on the feedback received from various quarters. 

It doesn't advocate a standard step-by-step methodology but provides the principles that should be followed in ensuring that products are developed and improved continuously.

The tools we discussed above seek to provide a suitable launchpad for businesses looking for the best agile project implementation platforms. 

Regardless of what you choose, you're assured of better productivity and boosted efficiency across your organization.
