The chances of a fresh lead converting drop by 10x after only five minutes.

Small business' biggest mistake is thinking that the deal is complete once they have a client. It’s just the beginning. Just because someone buy's something from you doesn’t mean they won’t buy from you again. Customer's are likely to return if you provide high-quality goods or service's. Whenever possible, upselling should be relevant to the consumer’s need's and help them achieve their goal's.

## Leadific Features

The app solves a huge problem that affects all small businesses.

Here’s how this app came to be:

Abdul and Chance, the founders, have long worked with small businesses to generate leads. 

However, most small businesses could not convert these leads into paying customers. A multi-step follow-up process is required for sales. And the majority of small businesses lack the knowledge, time, or resources to set this up.

The idea occurred to Chance that the sales process needs to be automated. And this is where an app like Leadific comes into play.

Email warming is the practice of introducing a new email address to an email service provider (ESP) or a recipient's inbox gradually in order to establish a good reputation and increase deliverability.
