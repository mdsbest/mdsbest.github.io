![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Pmpf9iv1Xz20Xt9v5WwjMBBDshO1lRFz_3OZZlym1mNYoKjp-oWAaV6sWhukXWzJFVopzKhnfqJGwyCkpAqNPwfvnPM7B57vdwAjqQcf3Fk5Z8IkjYE7krN5T_tPxAMGmwkw95AR_-HkPTQPv5AZrG4)

This tab shows you the billing cycle, which you can choose from monthly to a 48-month subscription.

Here, you can search for your preferred domain name. Unfortunately, Hosting24 does not offer a free domain name. However, you may purchase from them for as low as $0.99 a year.

Once your login is successful, you will be greeted with the hPanel dashboard, just like Hostinger’s.

The interface of Hosting24 is simple to use and ideal for beginners. You can manage your hosting specifics, domains, servers and check your user credentials from there. If you don't like hPanel, you can switch to cPanel, the most popular control panel in the hosting market.

## Hosting24 Control Panel

hPanel

Hostinger's professionals for their customers created this control panel. It is designed to work with Linux distributions. hPanel could only be utilized for shared hosting at the time. Because Hosting24 is a subsidiary of Hostinger, they share the same hPanel.

hPanel appears to be a more user-friendly option than cPanel. For example, because all of the options are displayed on the front page, a secondary menu appears on the left if you click on one of them. As a result, navigating between sections will be simple.

This control panel contains nearly all of the necessary functionality, such as domain and email administration, DNS zone editor, file and database manager, and so on. You might also manage account security by establishing file keys, limiting IP addresses, and configuring hotlink protection.

Apart from these options, the main difference is the ability to manage all of your things in a single panel. You can, for example, view your payment history, purchase additional hosting services, and upgrade existing ones.

### Home

The Home page is where you may set up and manage your services, as well as any pending ones.

### Hosting

This section will display you all of your Cloud, WordPress, or Shared hosting packages, and you will be able to Manage, Renew, and Upgrade them and add new websites from there.

A selection of hosting alternatives will appear once you pick the Hosting tab in the Menu Bar. Click the Manage button next to your domain name to access additional settings.

WordPress, Order Details, Accounts, Emails, and other elements linked to your websites will appear on a separate page. 

Domains, Website Builders, File Managers, and Backups are all available. FTP Accounts, Databases, Advance, and a variety of other tools are also accessible.

#### WordPress

WordPress will be the first item in your hosting account, with its logo. WordPress may be installed on your domain from this page.

If your WordPress site is already up and running, click the icon to access its interface. After that, you'll be sent to your WordPress dashboard.

#### Orders

You may examine your order use details, renew your hosting and domain information, change your plan to a different hosting plan, and adjust your site's primary domain under the Orders area of WordPress.

#### Account

There will be two possible alternatives under the Order tab of your account.

The first tab displays all of your account data, including domain information such as name servers, Website Details, Email Details, File Upload Details, and Website Builder information.

The second option, Update Password, allows you to update your password, as the name suggests.

### Email

Each of your email accounts registered with Hosting24's free mail services, as well as your Business and Enterprise accounts, is included here.

Email Accounts, Email Forwarders, Catch-All Emails, Auto Responders, and Mail Servers Control are all available in the Emails section, where you may manage all of your website's email accounts and settings.

### Domains

This section is all about domains; you may renew, transfer, freeze, or unlock your domains, as well as purchase new ones or manage DNS Zones for existing ones.

The Domain section offers information regarding domain administration. This shows the current status of your domain, as well as the Registration and Expiry Dates.

### Servers

All of your VPS plans will be displayed in the Servers section of hPanel.

### SSL

This section appears when you have already installed your initial Lifetime or Comodo SSL, and you may manage your SSL settings from there.

### Billing

This section is designed to keep track of all your services, bills, and payment methods; a thorough tutorial to the Billing section can also be found here.

### Help

As the name suggests, if you ever need assistance, you should look through this section; they provide various tutorials and the option to contact their remarkable Customer Success team.

### Store

In this section, you'll discover all of Hosting24's available services in one place, making it simple to order with just a few taps.

### Files

#### File Manager

The File Manager is located in the files area and is used to manage all of your website's files, including HTML, CSS, and JS, as well as PHP and database files. These files are shown in directories, making it easier to manage them more easily.

#### Backup

Backups allow users to manage their website backups efficiently. Hosting24 provides free weekly backups, and you can also purchase daily backups from them.

#### FTP Accounts

You can add or remove supplemental users who use or control your site's hosting services in the FTP Accounts area.

### Databases

#### MySQL Database

You can manage your site's databases in the databases section, which are hosted for free by Hosting24. In MySQL Databases, you can establish or delete a new database and database user for your website.

#### phpMyAdmin

You may also manage the list of phpMyAdmin databases directly in phpMyAdmin and enable easy access from the [Hosting24](https://serp.ly/hosting24) panel.

### Advanced

Numerous advanced solutions exist, such as DNS Zone Editor, which may be used to adjust domain settings, and Cron Jobs, which is meant to schedule operations to be performed on servers.

Cache Manager is an application used to speed up your website via caching and improve the SEO of your page. In the advanced area, you can choose between GIT and SSL.

## Hosting24 Website Builder

Hosting24's website builder, like Hostinger's, is Zyro.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/etrceZ-dm08yzvofVEBZlRisjI0b6qlBz16NpxMQjS3Xpp32LV9xc_g5ejr5e9vEMV5SnXGr4IIn5WbfFxqBm73Eqh9OkjxjFCWF92HYLQBHzw6etz4HQXENNVZtVR6vX7A8rj1WUCNftQD5156rSHA)

Zyro is a website builder that also offers web hosting. It is the creation of the well-known team Hostinger and allows customers to build and deploy simple websites quickly.

Despite its lack of powerful functions, Zyro has a lot of potential value for people who want to create a simple web presence or an online business.

Zyro is intended for complete beginners and takes convenience to a whole new level.

Zyro offers a more comprehensive solution. They've simplified the basic website builder even more and added more features to let consumers simply develop sophisticated websites. 

This includes the ability to generate content, optimize design, and much more automatically.

### Apps Installer

Hosting24's hPanel includes its own Apps Installer.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/AQtCsUYXWbMiLUbmC3bUAY9YqqUBbURpp4yil7onX13L-UVJNmeRn27opZYL9MmT3POEk-1MGPqQRcnZnm0tcQZpMN-74A9P1C_a7iW_-HBn7kTZGWCtp1XYBSQfLu7f9xvYhkItZErW-_PMfp88kdU)

You can install software quickly and easily with Auto-Installer. This application enables the user to rapidly install any CMS available on your hPanel account, including WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, and many others.

To get started, go to the Hosting tab and scroll down to the Auto Installer section.

You can utilize Auto Installer's search box to look for a specific application, such as WordPress, or you can choose from all of the available features on the same screen.

Following that, you must enter all of the necessary installation information.

When you're finished filling out the necessary information, click Install, and the installer will do the rest! Any databases required by your apps will be created promptly as well.

## Hosting24 Customer Support

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/z5L-AhTApojGROYjfzfDMK5rIxiWvrfMklrlgL_Np01qdMfiBbOmlnWoSfcbvxpWljnTBG8Cf6iD05nYYnOugvGZ_7lxloehZaVGr4TMbaxWgJ7oB3VwNxhlWB_KthLZ6qgYqOn8NS8-Q0LECktTa2Y)

[Hosting24](https://serp.ly/hosting24) provides excellent customer support based on users’ reviews; however, a live chat option for presales is lacking. This would require you to first purchase a subscription in order to gain access to the live chat facility.

A live chat support option enables consumers to address issues swiftly and is the most convenient way to answer questions. The support team provides dedicated service 24 hours a day, seven days a week via an inquiry form on their website.

On a more positive note, you can contact the tech support staff by email or the website's Inquiry Form.

In addition, they provide a dedicated knowledge base, FAQ page, and a series of articles to help you understand what is current. The knowledge base is well organized and simple to navigate.

## Buyer’s Guide For Hosting24

Hosting24's hosting options are all based on Linux.

Hosting24 offers three types of shared hosting plans: single, premium, and business. The entry-level plan includes one website, 30 GB of storage, and 100 GB of bandwidth. You can receive 100 websites, 200 GB of storage, and unlimited bandwidth by upgrading the Business plan.

Resellers have two plans to choose from: the Starter plan and the Business plan. The primary distinction between the two accounts is that the Starter plan is limited to 50 GB of storage space and 500 GB of bandwidth.

If you require a more powerful option, Hosting24 also provides VPS hosting plans.

Hosting24 also offers Email Hosting, cPanel Hosting, WordPress Hosting, Free Hosting, and Cloud Hosting.

## Plans and Pricing

### Shared Hosting plans start at $0.80/month.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/v7YZy1q-BjAzWdGSgw9TTpjqOrPW8Kq-T6Q5LrraCx-RnX2V_qGHskCgjY8fxHiYH4PX562jg7f4LfwmeNYN_uBhwtukht-6HAHiVUNv6w5rFHAo8wdi7BEoVuHiN5OVqmwQhITJb0tdmNa7i3r3n2Y)

Shared hosting is a type of web hosting in which numerous users are allocated to a single server. The provider implements all features, restrictions, and functions. Users on a shared hosting server share a pool of disk space, bandwidth, RAM, and other resources.

Without server management or coding experience, you may use shared hosting to establish a completely functional website. It is also the most cost-effective hosting option because server costs are shared among many users.

The most affordable shared plan costs less than $40 for four years, which is uncommon in the web hosting industry. Given that the monthly payment is roughly $8, that's nearly five times the cost for nearly 50 times the duration. Furthermore, going for a more extended period may be less expensive.

That same shared plan costs $7.99 per month if purchased monthly, but only $2.15 per month if purchased in three months, meaning you can receive three months of hosting for the price of one.

Hosting24's fantastic introductory offer makes the cost worthwhile. You also have 30 days of money-back guarantee to change your mind.

### cPanel Hosting plans start at $1.95/month.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hF-c2SItJ5wgLQquorNnElO8t3gs-cJ_e9nCsa1CjnYViq7nDhaS1xiHM5BW-u01d2Cel2HMu8JrHp_JZaTkp8Rvopy9graAbGnZCyZi0M6T43LpKbai43YwAsWoN3-lYs602u7yBnsgVNLMUQ5eJkE)

cPanel is a management tool designed to help you get the most out of your hosting space.

For starters, it enables you to establish and use email addresses. Email communication is now an essential component of any internet business or activity. To help you keep your inbox clean, cPanel hosting allows you to set up forwarders, auto-responders, and anti-spam solutions.

You will also obtain an easy-to-use File Manager to assist you with day-to-day tasks. You can also use an FTP program to create FTP users and link to your hosting account. A useful tool for granting file access to a developer or collaborator.

Domain management tools will help you add extra domains or subdomains to your server while also controlling their DNS records. Not to mention MySQL, which is an essential component of several scripts and websites. 

You can easily create MySQL databases and users using cPanel hosting, and you can manage them with phpMyadmin. Remote MySQL connections are also permitted as an added benefit.

You will also be able to enable Cloudflare to safeguard and boost your website. Overall, cPanel hosting attempts to include all of the tools you'll need to get your project off to a good start.

### Reseller Hosting plans start at $17.45/month.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/qo2AsVT9QzXyHkarwXNbJ-_S7YHkmMHnrkEwfJGQl15ymATil5-a49kpS5DOHAVnA5hNZ4SvM44wRLeGqt0DhESSIsFkVD_oZz6w9Q8LljATEwLTUz_RSf9EqRFYtZEVxjp6nzlGCV2QFn8_FoazmW8)

Reseller hosting is a form of web hosting in which the owner can use the resources allotted to them to resell hosting packages to people worldwide.

Cloud hosting allows programs and websites to be accessed via cloud resources. Solutions, unlike traditional hosting, are not implemented on a single server. Instead, the application or website is hosted by a network of connected virtual and physical cloud servers, allowing for greater flexibility and scalability.

A virtual private server, commonly known as a VPS, is a robust web hosting service. It is referred to be the "middle ground" between shared hosting and a dedicated server. It is called 'private' because users are given root access, making them the masters of the hosting platform. Each virtual private server (VPS) has its own version of the operating system. 

When combined with superuser access, you can install anything as long as the operating system supports it. As a result, virtual server hosting enables customers to experience true flexibility and create the ideal atmosphere for any project.

Linux VPS hosting is a good alternative for individuals who work on projects that require a lot of resources. If you have a website on shared hosting and begin to experience errors relating to resource constraints, it is a sign that you require a more capable platform. 

VPS services are also a powerful weapon in the hands of developers and other tech-savvy individuals. With root access, you may create the ideal environment for any project and change the majority of server-side parameters. While newcomers may have a more difficult time initially, all VPS operating systems have extensive documentation and large online communities.

## Server Speed and Uptime

Uptime is an important factor to consider when choosing a web host.

When you visit the Hosting24 website, one of the first things you'll notice is a 99.9 percent uptime guarantee.

According to Website Setup, Hosting24 failed to keep its claim, delivering an average of 98.73 percent uptime with four days of downtime during the past year.

Google recommends a load time of 200 milliseconds. This is because customers will lose patience if your website takes too long to load.

Hosting24 worked admirably in terms of load times. Over the last year, they averaged 700 milliseconds. It's not horrible, but it's not fantastic either. Nonetheless, it outperformed the industry average of 890ms load times.

Needless to say, the speed of your hosting is one of the most significant elements for site speed. When the foundation is faulty, there are only so many things you can do.

## Security and Backups

Websites are under constant attack from various types of malware and targeted attacks. You may believe that new websites are safe, but hackers do not discriminate and view smaller sites as easy prey.

Hosting24 continues its apparent customer-centric approach by paying close attention to your website's security.

To proactively safeguard your site, several of their hosting plans include Cloudflare DDOS protection and the ClamAV antivirus scanning.

They will also perform backups on a weekly basis. You should have daily backups in an idealistic situation. It's not a horrible bargain because they're tossing it in for free, but many other sites need you to pay extra.

They also provide SpamAssassin protection for emails.
