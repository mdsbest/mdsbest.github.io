## [Blinkist](https://serp.ly/blinkist) Review: Save Time, Learn Faster, Retain More

Reading is crucial to self-improvement.

If you're a non-fiction bookworm like me, there are two major issues when choosing a book.

It's impossible to read everything and most of it's bad. Books repeat concepts.

Choosing a book with no new ideas costs effort and money.

Executive summaries let you decide if a book is worth reading. I tried numerous executive summary services before Blinkist.

I reviewed the app because I love it. I might inspire you to attempt it.

## What is Blinkist?

**[The Blinkist app](https://serp.ly/blinkist/)** maximizes your time since there's always a lot to accomplish.

This software has over 3000 non-fiction book summaries for professionals and students.

Time management with this tool makes it easier.

Consider a time when you needed to skim a book to speak with a client, compose an assignment, or review important information before a supervisor meeting. Reading book summaries helps you swiftly grasp a text's main themes.

Blinks are summaries. It might help you learn more about a topic or choose a book to read.

## Why Use Blinkist?

There's no denying that nothing beats a good book.

One of my favorite pastimes is still sitting by the fire with a good book. However, this is a review, not a general review of the reading.

There are times when using a book summary service like Blinkist would be more practical and convenient.

Here are the reasons why Blinklist is great. You want to understand the book, but you don't want to spend days deciphering it. You want to read less and apply more book teachings.

You like the book despite mixed reviews. You're skeptical since many readers disagree with you. The book's message is good, but it's mostly filler. You want to understand what you're reading.

The book is fine. Well-written and informative. You don't have time to read it. You may have read it before and want a refresher.

## Do Summaries of Books Hinder Learning?

If you use a summary service like Blinkist, you can read more books in less time.

You can learn a lot about a topic and get to the level of an expert by reading summaries written by various experts and professionals on the subject.

If you keep looking at things from all angles, eventually you'll see the whole image.

It would appear that the greater one's capacity to read, the better.

But that's not always the case, because missing out on the details means missing out on a lot of the story.

You may maximize the learning benefits of your Blinkist reading in five simple ways.

**Tips for maximizing the use of summaries:**

- Topic: Read and compare opinions on a topic you like.

- Blinkist lets you read many book abstracts in a day. Read all perspectives. Each book addresses the same subject differently.

- Note the main points in each summary: Write down the main points from book summaries. This ensures you can revisit the books and remember the teachings.

- Read the book if you like opinions: These summaries will include observations and lessons you agree with or want to learn more about. Read the book.

- After reading several perspectives on your topic, form your own opinions.

## Blinkist's Function

Here are some of the nuts and bolts of Blinkist from a user perspective.

### How Does Blinkist Get New Books?

Blinkist has an online version as well as a fantastic app.

The Blinkist app's creators research the best-selling and most popular books in a variety of genres.

They also consult with industry experts and read reviews until they find the best candidates to add to their database.

Users can also recommend books for the Blinkist team to include in their next batch of summaries. These ideas are added to the wishlist, where members can vote for their favorites.

The 'Wishlist' feature allows app users to help decide on future content.

Providing book recommendations via Wishlist.

### How are the books summarized?

When the Blinkist team selects a book, a group of freelancers read it, identify the key lessons, and then turn those lessons into a series of 'blinks.'

The blinks highlight the main ideas in each book while skipping all the extraneous details.

Every Blinkist summary is about 15 minutes long to read, and there is also an audio version.

### Best Books of Blinkist

There is no question that Blinkist provides its users with access to a huge selection of nonfiction books.

**Categories include:**

- History and Biography.

- Small Business Development and Entrepreneurship.

### Book Summaries

There are mobile and desktop versions of Blinkist. When it's convenient for you, borrow any book from our extensive collection.

It's like tucking hundreds of engaging and informative books into your purse or briefcase so you can pick and choose which to read before an important presentation.

In your app, users can save book synopses to read later.

#### Blinkist Library

Blinkist users can access their libraries.

Your library stores book summaries.

**You can add books to your library by:**

- To browse categories, select the "discover" tab.

- You can check out some of the most well-liked books and latest movies by browsing the 'discover' screen.

- You can look for a specific book or author by using the search button.

- The Blinkist blog features book recommendations organized for a variety of uses.

#### What a Blinkist library looks like.

The screenshot that you'll find below depicts what a library may look like on your home computer or portable device. As you can see, navigating it is simple, and it offers a high level of intuitiveness to the person using it.

#### Book summary pages

Each book on Blinkist is accompanied by a brief synopsis that provides basic information about the book, author, and audience for the summary.

When you open a summary of a book, you can view all of the book's blinks.

As was previously indicated, these are the book's most important takeaways.

The menu allows you to quickly jump to a specific blink in the summary if you'd rather not read the full thing.

If reading isn't your thing, you can always just listen to the summary.

The use of AI to read each summary is not optimal. Nonetheless, I estimate the speed to be 1.25x, and I hardly detect the robot's voice at that rate.

After you've finished reading the overview, there's a handy link to the purchase page.

### What Does it Feel Like to Use Blinkist?

This app is simple. Its simplistic interface suits busy people.

The free and premium plans offer the same features.

Professionals and busy students love Blinkist's clean design.

You can borrow over 3000 books from the vast library.

Check it often to see the latest titles, since the developers hope to add 40 per month.

## Blinkist Pricing

This section covers Blinkist pricing in the US, Germany, Canada, Australia, and the UK, as well as team plans. I prepared a Blinkist Pricing Table including annual and monthly pricing for the most popular nations after a lot of searching.

### Does Blinkist Cost Anything?

The good news is that you don't have to pay anything to use Blinkist.

With the free plan, users can check out random daily picks.

Users on the free plan can't choose which book to read or check out. You can pick an interesting title at random every day, but it might not be the one you want.

If you want to learn about a lot of different things, a free plan is a great choice.

### Blinkist Premium Cost

Users also consider the app's low pricing to be a good deal considering the wealth of information and entertainment it offers.

Costs for premium plans are based on the subscription type and region. Customers can test out the premium package at no cost for a whole week.

To help you better understand how Blinkist's pricing varies by area and subscription type, I have produced a table below in which I have examined the costs in some of the most popular regions for Blinkist.

The premium plan's features are yours to use for free during the trial period.

In the first week, there is no penalty for canceling.

When you sign up for the monthly plan, you'll be charged for the first three months upfront. You'll need to shell out the full subscription cost for the yearly plan after your free trial period ends.

After your current membership term ends, you will be able to switch to a higher tier if you so want.

### Blinkist for Business

If you don't use it midway through your trial, cancel.

If you're not using it, it's a waste of money. No online review will change that.

## Blinkist Cons

Even though I've been using Blinkist for more than a year and use it every day, it's not the best way to learn.

It wouldn't be a fair review if I didn't point out some things about Blinkist that I don't like.

Reading a whole book is the best thing ever. Reading a summary will give you an idea of what the main points are, but it won't teach you as much.

Blinkist hires freelancers to sum up their books, and some of the summaries aren't as good as they could be. These are getting updated, and the quality is great in general.

There are some summaries that don't get the point across. This is partly because they're trying to fit a whole book into ten minutes of reading.

Blinkist is good for business owners and people who are interested in self-improvement, but not for much else.

## Conclusion

The Blinkist App as a whole is very good. If you don't have the time to read a whole book, Blinkist is the next best thing

People who want to learn more, in general, can use the basic plan, which gives them random daily picks, but the premium plan is the real deal.

If you choose the annual plan, you can try it out for free and only have to pay after seven days. This means you won't have to pay for the app until you're sure you want to use it.

During the free trial, you can use all of the great paid features. You can check out any of more than 3000 books, mark the important parts, send them to Evernote, and even listen to audio files.
