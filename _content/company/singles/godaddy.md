In short, GoDaddy is a trusted hosting provider offering a quality hosting service to its clientele. In the next section of this GoDaddy review, I will be trying out a web hosting service from this hosting provider to give your an inside look and a more comprehensive review.

## Getting Started With GoDaddy

Opening GoDaddy's homepage the first time, I was greeted by this screen. On this page, you can see a domain registration section, but first, you need to search the availability of your domain name. GoDaddy offers a domain name for as low as $0.19 for the first year. 

There is also an option to quickly transfer your domain from another domain registrar or migrate your site from other hosting providers.

![Screenshot form GoDaddy homepage](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ejTYL4P-2ewOw1kwP8oT0LlyewE_VyOI3qwKW2kVUEFQ5F0_VHND6onpCHH4h6UUPPa_ZDbm9Z6AfCaXC-cUPTgpmVqP1v0dmOKEkJERK4htUnnIVdLwukgKdPK7T4H7dYP2MGowIdLTZKFtdGRE-sQ)

Other things on their homepage are the buttons to view plans and pricing for professional email, SSL security, shared web hosting, website building, dedicated servers, and  Microsoft 365. Clicking this button will redirect to each service page, where you can also see the features included in each plan.

For this review, I opted to try its web hosting services. I chose the Starter plan that costs $3.99 per month. This shared hosting plan is best for a single website with minimal storage requirements. If you are looking to start building an online presence, then this affordable hosting provider is perfect.

Included in this plan are the following:

- 512 MB RAM

- One website

- Unmetered bandwidth

- 30 GB of storage

- One database

- Free 1-click WordPress install

- Easy-to-use control panel

- 1-click install of over 150 free apps

- 24/7 network security

- Server resources on-demand

- 1-click domain name setup

- Global data centers

The first step of the sign-up process is to click the Add to Cart button. The next page is a purchase page where I had to chose my billing cycle and domain name. I decided on the annual billing cycle, then checked the availability of my domain name. Domain name registration costs $12.17, and the Full Domain Privacy & Protection costs $9.99 per year.

Here is my total purchase:

![Screenshot of GoDaddy shopping cart](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/IQR4t1P4VExdQMg0tE7T1eRq96KfDAFNb5oYJwebmkxbtMgyJbnBC5yx_lauNAR0OMwGfIlR0mNamAMaq973aLEQ89JhHmPGMHM9MxD-4-8noop7tnmTfFaEX8xBiJ3bm3xdKlHhQShrEFVwiv3cjkM)

Before paying the amount stated, I was prompted to create a GoDaddy account first. I chose my  Google account to set up an account.

The following page was about the Billing Information. I had to input my name, address, phone number, and organization to proceed.

The next part of the checkout process was securing my payment. GoDaddy offers three different payment methods: Credit card, Alipay, or Paypal.

The last part of the sign-up process was to review my order before finally completing my purchase. After, a receipt was sent by GoDaddy to my email account.

## Using and Managing Your Website with GoDaddy

After completing my purchase, I was redirected to this homepage.

![Screenshot of GoDaddy client's dashboard](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/69uPK5GxiUwwC4STLXwnVnekx7viSUtygBzVt0s3y5Lt40amgTrgxHL5j6hb2fzymrJEDUIlb6eQ08Fh8fsMLhufMK5frBGxjNuq_NQHMMedi5ucBdGJYEBQM8p2vnSa0C1Z0qp5uWCKpG5_vKcK_3M)

GoDaddy uses cPanel for its Linux servers and Plesk for the Windows server plans. In this review, I will walk you through how to access your cPanel account from your GoDaddy hosting dashboard.

To access the Cpanel admin, you need to go to the My Products Tab then to the Web Hosting tab. Under Web Hosting, click manage then settings. From this page, you can now view your cPanel login details.
