As usual, for this Hostwinds review, we'll go for their cheapest Shared Hosting plan - the basic plan priced at $6.74 per month. 

Once you have browsed and decided the hosting plan you're going for, click Get Started. 

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/DPtqh4bOdNlhgP09x2VuhVFlzS1VSV-MRylMG9-Fg4Idun90f1y-7Cyc_007ZCI2gJp_qEaSl9BYwdwJHtF_mNgNVLWKROtGEvptJblvaMzo3bV-IlLF-kzIQe_3ltk7WnWMKrEuMOjTWY2bxDpWtDM)

This will prompt you to a page where you can sign-up or log in to your account. 

But because we are signing up for a new account, we'll fill out the tab on the left side. 

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/n0SHjUXY5JHGr3lDY6XgSBFHfO09F2KM5mNr68qigMWaTcxw6R1b5hf426pcL5EfTyjMEg3Bd7vCx0dZMlL-ebeGQOdwhQ07gYmD8jc7IlJoYaNtCziGmsA8kBiA0nSc9bF7ydLL1swaKxzq6S4R1wc)

The tab you will see upon submitting the sign-up form would be the client information. Here, you need to type in your full name, address, and phone number. 

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QmXJ3Bx4GbLS99-l7PSQCGPT0t5vCQ2W2-BMJzBL7A_VMwgdNPfh4ZckrLHiya31X1GSb-jEf0FKfpE4lXPGHH_eSXQcLWAYOOnEKQr7d943-JHIB0_gZ7v3V27pBL7SgrzUPaDWnZYWWXIJTlI43w0)

Scrolling down, you need to set up the domain name you wish to use. 

Note: Shared hosting plans do not come with a free domain name. 

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kFJoHYjvvTLXk1bEL0ZqxNhPhwsGUjo_5_Qg99H389Vxo8x3L8pP5jHIUGA4YBtkCV-v_6fYqwSCd0ZftuitoG5W3OoZ0yqHnPz8-zuBur6hb_K1Vj2gpTTBlwOXfe8LFhXwabOP-JQkODTnfdYtHpM)

The next step would be the Package Information. Here, you get to choose which billing cycle you prefer. Bear in mind that the longer the commitment, the lower the price you'll pay for your web hosting service. 

You can also choose which data center location you want to use, as well as the hosting plan itself. Optional add-ons can also be found here if you're going to boost your website's security and performance. 

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/YFSuQqcGRMwC41Fli7l41he61iL2WbVErmUoJ0_aDVdmpQxkS4UZpTDX-uybC7YF98Cf0S6iybwqSKGuvH4UwpSm016pr1gqY0mHpeWOHIWyRazfVox8UO4VTc8WT3xpNEs_DEU-ymOUD4HkwBQftyQ)

The last tab you'll find on this page is the Payment Information tab. Here, you have the option to pay via Credit Card, using PayPal, or using your preferred Cryptocurrency. 

Once done, click Complete Order. 

After this, you should receive an email stating that your order is being processed, and your account should be activated shortly.

After you've logged in successfully, you will be greeted with your Hostwinds account dashboard. 

Here, you have an overview of your web hosting service, Actions tab where you can perform different tasks such as cPanel login, webmail login, change passwords, upgrade or downgrade your hosting plan, change your domain, and cancel your subscription. 

## HostWinds Control Panel 

cPanel is the most popular control panel in the hosting industry, and for excellent purpose: it is easy to use. The control panel allows you to manage your files, databases, email accounts, and other website hosting-related duties. 

### Email 

You can establish custom email accounts for your domain in the Emails section of cPanel. There are tools available for creating new emails, configuring forwarders and autoresponders, dealing with spam, and more. 

### Domains 

You may add new domains to your account, set up parked domains, create subdomains, arrange redirects, and much more under the Domains section of cPanel. Before you can configure cPanel, you must first have a domain registered and linked to your server. As a result, solely adding it to cPanel will have no effect. 

### File Management 

You can backup your cPanel account, view and alter files stored in your account, evaluate your disk consumption, and even create and manage FTP accounts through the files section of cPanel.

### Databases 

Many current websites would be impossible to build without a database, which works invisibly behind the scenes to handle the website's content. Briefly said, the database stores all of the information on your website, including all pages, posts, and personal information. 

### Metrics 

Regular monitoring of numerous website analytics is crucial for your sales and economics. You may study a range of statistics, track mistakes, and monitor bandwidth usage in the Metrics area. 

This is where you can find out where your traffic is coming from, how many visitors you have, and which parts of your website are being used the most. 

### Security 

Among the most important things you need to do is make your website secure. You could use the tools in this section to limit SSH access, block IP addresses, and prevent the hotlinking of your photos. You may also manage your website's security certificates from here. 

### Software 

You can enhance the functionalities of your site by accessing the software area. There are important tools accessible here to help you configure software on your website. Softaculous simplifies the installation of popular website programs such as WordPress and Drupal. 

Softaculous can be used to test many types of software as well as to start developing WordPress sites. 

### Advanced 

This category comprises activities that are uncommon but beneficial to your website's advancement.

### Preferences

The Preferences area allows you to customize numerous cPanel functions. Under Change Language, for one, you can change the display language; you can also update your Contact Information and perhaps reset your cPanel password under this area.

## HostWinds Website Builder

Weebly Website Builder 

Weebly website builder is a drag-and-drop site builder included in the shared and business hosting plans. This tool is ideal if you are a small business owner who is just getting started and wants to build simple websites on your own. You can personalize the layout with different themes and make it mobile-friendly.

## Softaculous Apps Installer

Softaculous Auto-Installer

## Buyer’s Guide For HostWinds 

## Plans and Pricing 

Shared Hosting plans start at $6.74/month.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/mmNGw1je8oqoNrmaf7nd_vx4rvqZRgHBmB-WOi3Z4fJnkx5iwIf96kzKnYXjUC2q5950pvbroToEq9kQzam9OSd6ABX6bZWxav8eA5sKUxv6rRF7xkT96CFO7Eyh6dsqmsCzXDX_DGZPrBiyfgtkmXA)

Hostwinds shared hosting plans provides appealing, cost-effective Linux-based shared hosting services in three varieties: Basic, Advanced, and Ultimate. Starting at $8.99 per month, the basic shared hosting plan includes unlimited monthly data transfers, unlimited storage, a free dedicated IP address, and the option to host a single domain.

Advanced shared hosting, which starts at $10.99 per month, expands on Basic by allowing you to host up to six domains.

The ultimate shared hosting plan adds the ability to host an unlimited number of domains for $12.99 per month. If you want a Hostwinds shared hosting package with room to grow, there's not much need to choose anything other than the Ultimate plan unless you're on a tight budget.

Hostwinds, like other web hosting companies, offers discounts if you join up for many months or even years.

VPS Hosting

A Virtual Private Server is for customers who want to construct their websites on servers with far more power than shared web hosting. Your website still uses server space with VPS hosting, but there are considerably fewer other sites competing for resources.

VPS hosting is more expensive than shared hosting, but it is well worth the cost if you anticipate a high traffic volume. VPS sites are also more secure because virtualization isolates part of their resources.

Hostwinds offers four levels of fully managed Linux and Windows-based services to choose from.

Linux VPS Hosting plans start at $8.24/month.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2XziVf3tSgtbKbJRbWQy2FSngOkZUiUYIWyLzhhXl-q-VYbbs0qrvb5VyB0lUFZsmHpJRgxe0NB82W-F6UAfn38nOET9umgz4rcFAbpN15Y-X6pbE1Rl-NysOHiwPEJovNLZIlZ1E-72kCA9RApQJkk)

The lowest tier of managed Linux VPS hosting costs $8.24 per month and includes 1GB of RAM, one CPU core, 30GB of SSD disk space, and 1TB of monthly data transfers, whereas the highest tier costs $38.24 per month and includes two CPU cores, 6GB of RAM, 100GB of SSD disk space, and 2TB of monthly data transfers.

Windows VPS Hosting plans start at $12.74/month.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6Mif5rfFHRTxUIv5W7_wFGiQpvoDBCqhzOKOVto02yhVPTSKx1TDHtmgwzhjFaq0ih26ahwKlNfvtk-h35wGppWfMLDwuNHa6Exeyr2PvcZXYFKZGdEAU4SdzbP86F3EFJIfBPb35VCV9BPZYkW_CH8)

In terms of hardware capacity, Windows VPS hosting plans offers the same range but at higher prices ranging from $12.74 per month to $42.74 per month.

Dedicated Hosting - A high-performance dedicated server hosting

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/mdAIFVyAW-cknnJsJlmYMlEzEXjPYlmATnYjPLHssnH8a5zC4vEpAHOvsaTWiFhGQlkiTS7tyLfgwfwT0gWTFMRc-QBQVOkqk63ddBUuAblwFP2_j7-jdQCZt5Zwomh0UHwtm1Bu00VxB5iNw7Bzw3w)

Hostwinds offers configurable or prefabricated Linux and Windows-based dedicated servers. Dedicated hosting is a robust hosting option that sets your website on its own server. As a result, your site gets access to massive server resources, allowing it to resist enormous visitor loads.

 Cloud Hosting - A virtualized private server with dedicated resources

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PIhY31sj9DlZzH7hz9s-mmsj_i9NPOK-DLyWVHLD7ngk3POTj5uFdrRHs-eQU8HcyAtc3ZtPmVvg13IZUYVcksymjwfLychnpGzWu3EQ6n3lPaLkz7wXm19LU_7MpWGy3D_NK_45zCgAygn6vC7MWR8)

Hostwinds also provides cloud hosting, a type of web hosting in which CPU, RAM, and other resources are distributed over a cloud server. It differs from standard hosting except for that single server power it. The benefit is that your website is not restricted to the resources of a single server.

Cloud hosting options from Hostwinds start at $4.99 per month for a meager 1GB of RAM, a single CPU core, and 1TB of monthly data transfers. The options range from $328.99 per month for 96GB of RAM, sixteen CPU cores, 750GB of storage, and 9TB of monthly data transfers to $328.99 per month for 96GB of RAM, sixteen CPU cores, 750GB of storage, and 9TB of monthly data transfers.

Reseller Hosting - Start your web hosting business without dealing with structural issues.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/o1r0WczEUW7aA3k_K4NaHrJUFPxHdvG9IBw2n5R1W4jf89VBwmmf6PtC0D3bjDwrFuUKmoJcHeJjjxO5cP5JqXF1aUVscIHLti-x3T4XuN4Utzk3Db-REpKya9jUwZfESCG3sJxDwA2jk3aNvr44dZA)

Hostwind's reseller hosting plans are similar to its shared hosting plans in that they start at $5.24 per month for unlimited email, storage, and data transfers. There are dedicated, and VPS plans for Linux and Windows and shared hosting for only Linux.

The servers have the same amount of RAM and storage as those supplied directly by Hostwinds, which is not often the case. Hostwinds also allows you to brand the servers you lease, and it offers 24/7 tech support.

## Server Speed and Uptime

Website uptime is one of the most important aspects of a hosting service. Clients or users would be unable to access your business or even use your products and services if your website is down, and that they might never come back.

Additionally, Hostwinds offers a 99.999% uptime guarantee.

Over the past year, WebsiteSeup's testing has yielded strong results, with an average of 99.99 percent uptime and only five outages. They achieved nearly faultless outcomes for the entire year, which is astounding!

Moving on to server speeds, a fast page speed is essential for a range of factors. For instance, 14 percent of your site's users will quit and browse elsewhere if your page loads take too long, and one out of every two individuals expects a site to load in less than two seconds.

Hostwinds asserts that its system was designed from the start with speed in focus. To that purpose, it employs SSD Drives to boost the speed and efficiency of sites hosted on its platform. Hostwinds offers high read and write speeds and uses a Route Optimized Network to guarantee that the quickest path to connectivity is always used. 

Hostwinds has been producing sluggish speed statistics for the past year, with an average of 837 milliseconds.

## Security and Backups

Hostwinds provides Website Monitoring for its shared and reseller services, which monitors your site 24 hours a day, seven days a week. If your site is down, it will immediately send a help ticket on your behalf.

Hostwinds backs up your website every evening to ensure the safety of your essential data and files. If something terrible happens, such as a malware attack, you'll be able to recover your site to a relatively recent version. You will also be able to save backups permanently and view them whenever you want. This is unusual for cheap shared hosting plans, which may only feature backups every two weeks, once a week, or not at all.

## Final Thoughts

[Hostwinds](https://serp.ly/hostwinds) is a wonderful web host for small businesses looking for unlimited storage and bandwidth, especially if you foresee a high volume of traffic to your site. Those looking for more affordable solutions, on the other hand, should seek elsewhere, as several competitors provide common attributes at lower prices.

We hope this Hostwinds review has helped find your hosting company!
