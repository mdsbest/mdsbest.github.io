## Dot5Hosting Walkthrough

[Dot5Hosting](https://serp.ly/dot5hosting) was created in 2002 to create a single bundle for all of its users. Dot5Hosting was owned by Endurance International Group, which manages almost 100 small web hosting companies like HostGator, Bluehost, and A Small Orange; at some time, however, it is unclear when.

Dot5Hosting is well-known for providing one of the top low-cost web hosting services available. They take pride in their dependable service and experienced customer support personnel.

Dot5Hosting has two data centers located in Boston, Massachusetts. They have a sophisticated infrastructure, including DELL equipment and multiple power supplies. Considering this, they do not provide any uptime guarantee. However, they appear to offer all you'll need for a decent uptime, particularly with the 24/7 security and DELL high-performance servers.

In this review, we will put one of their web hosting plans through its paces in terms of performance, dependability, support, features, and cost. If you want to know what we think, keep reading!

## Getting Started With Dot5Hosting

To get started, head to the [Dot5Hosting](https://serp.ly/dot5hosting) website. First impression? Minimalism. You will be greeted with Dot5Hosting's simple homepage. No promotional prices or introductory offers are seen here. It's just straight up the login button, and if you're a new customer, below is the Get Started Now button. You'll find the features you get when you host your website on this hosting company as you scroll down.

Additionally, Dot5Hosting has partnered with iPage; that way, you get a more advanced web hosting experience; as they claim. Dot5Hosting only has one plan where you get everything you need to grow your online business. We'd say that their main webpage is a bit misleading since we got redirected to iPage once we clicked "Get Started," but we figured that they have a separate link for their hosting plan and features.

Here's an overview of their hosting solution:

Shared Web Hosting - a vDeck-based shared hosting plan

For this review, we'll explore their Unlimited Web Hosting service.

### Domains

In the Domains area of vDeck, you can add and configure domains, create subdomains, configure redirects, and much more.

Some recent websites would be impossible to create without using a database, which works discreetly behind the scenes to manage the website's content. In a nutshell, the database contains all of the information on your website, including all pages, posts, and personal data.

You also could manage your databases with phpMyAdmin, which is accessible via the MySQL Management tab. phpMyAdmin gives you more control over your database's structure and data. You can build and delete tables, import and export data, run SQL queries, repair tables, and execute various other tasks.

### Metrics

This section enables you to narrow down where your traffic is coming from, how many visitors you have, and which portions of your website are most visited.

### Security

You can add SSL certificates to your site for as little as $35.99. This generates an "https" web address and informs both search engines and website users that any information they submit to your site is encrypted and thus safer.

An SSL certificate is a must-have if you intend to sell physical or digital products. It may also provide you with a slight boost in the search engines. However, in terms of SSL certificates, it is a little costly. It is also worth mentioning that certificates provide varying levels of security.

SiteLock is also a tool that protects your website from malware and hacking. SiteLock is a well-known brand that provides adequate security. It is well worth the investment to secure your website.

### Software

This is the place where you can extend the functionality of your website. PHP is a programming language that is constantly updated and improved.

Dot5 provides live chat and phone support 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Their email address is also included at the bottom of their contact page. The majority of the customer support links, on the other hand, take you to their knowledge base.

In our case, we opted for live chat support to receive an instant response regarding our queries.

The customer support agent responded in a minute. They directly answered our query, which was good. However, they did not offer any help concerning setting up an account.

Moreover, their phone support is only accessible to users in the United States.
