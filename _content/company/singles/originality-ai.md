## Originality AI: Review, Walkthrough & Demo

In 2023, if you are a web publisher, you are going to have to deal with artificial intelligence content no matter what your opinion is on the subject.

Because the term in question has a low difficulty score in Ahrefs' database, it will be difficult for your freelancers, content services, or even in-house content writers to resist the urge to test the waters with it the next time you give them a tedious SEO project.

On the other hand, if you're being offered content created by AI, you probably want to know if it was created by AI.

As a result, I put the AI Detection tool called Originality AI through its paces in a variety of challenging scenarios to determine whether or not it can identify content that is produced by GPT-3 and ChatGPT.

Is it possible for AI to help you capture AI?

As you are about to witness, the outcomes were somewhat... unexpected.

## What exactly is Originality.AI all about?

![](/images/originality-AI-1024x411.png)

Originality.ai presents itself as a piece of artificial intelligence content detection software. It analyzes the stuff that you provide and comes up with a score. A sliding scale ranging from 0 to 100 is used to determine the score. If the AI score is high, this indicates that there is a good chance that the content was generated by artificial intelligence.

In spite of the fact that the developers of this [software market](https://devinschumacher.com/email-marketing-software/) it primarily as an AI detection tool, I've discovered that it serves my needs better as a content quality checker. I explain it in greater detail below, in the part under "Most potent use for me."

As of GPT 3.0, the dominant natural language processing model before ChatGPT/GPT 3.5, the business asserts that it has achieved a success rate of 94% when identifying text that was generated by AI.

Before ChatGPT was released, GPT 3.0 was used by a number of well-known artificial intelligence programs.

## How precise is the Originality AI system?

It's presently in the beta testing phase. It is not absolutely correct. I ran some stuff that I was aware was NOT AI, but the system still awarded it a high grade for AI. It has a propensity to produce false positives.

But in my opinion, that's a positive development. Because of this, it is not only a [software for detecting AI but also a software that checks](https://devinschumacher.com/rank-checking-software/) the quality of information. The stuff that scored highly for artificial intelligence was not very good at all.

And this brings up a very significant topic. Simply omitting AI from a piece of writing does not guarantee that it is of high quality.

Checking for artificial intelligence is important, but you should also look into the game's overall quality. Because of this, I'm really looking forward to using this software, as preliminary tests have shown that it does a decent job of distinguishing between quality levels of fantastic, good, average, and crap.

Moving forward, every piece of material will be run via this technology, and the writers will be expected to reach a predetermined score. I have not yet decided what the appropriate score for it will be... I'll figure it out by feeding the majority of my successful articles into it and seeing what happens.

## Innovative A.I. Characteristics

Originality AI is very helpful for publishing companies, advertising agencies, and blogging platforms.

The tool assists in ensuring that the text is original, is sufficiently free from AI, and does not contain any instances of plagiarism.

Originality is important if you manage a website. AI will assist you in avoiding penalties imposed by Google, even if you do not employ AI in the content that you produce. It is beneficial both for established online publishers and for new bloggers just starting out.

Originality AI should be a top priority for you if you own a content marketing business or manage a large number of freelance authors.

The use of AI can make it easier to generate creative content for your customers. You will want to employ writers who are capable of producing original content because, in the not too distant future, AI will have a significant impact on the freelance writing industry.

## Originality AI - AI Detector

![](/images/originality-ai-feature-ai-content-detection-1-1024x442.png)

The AI Content Scanner and AI Detector is a really straightforward piece of software. It merely generates a score for artificial intelligence detection. On a scale ranging from 0 to 100, the score is derived, with 100 indicating an absence of any artificial intelligence.

At this time, there is no way to check how Originality is being used.

The score was generated by AI, or you may get comments on particular sections of the text. The tool has just been released, so I anticipate that they will add this capability at some point in the future as it develops.

The purpose of AI is to paste in individual sections of your message one at a time. In this method, you will be able to determine whether a certain piece is likely to cause problems and then revise it to reword phrases or add in new content.

## Checks for Possible Plagiarism

A plagiarism scanner program is also available from AI. The pricing is comparable to that of Copyscape, which is the most popular plagiarism checker available on the market.

They also give a table that displays instances of plagiarism discovered by the technology. Indeed, their home page was an exact match in every respect! It was correct in indicating that the content was plagiarized, although I'm not sure what caused the overall score to only reflect 80%.

## Complete Site Analysis of Originality.

The complete site scan functionality of AI is not yet online, but the development team has said that it would be available in the near future in a press release.

With this particular characteristic, Originality.

The AI scanner will do a check for both [duplicate material and content](https://devinschumacher.com/duplicate-content/) that was generated by AI on a whole website.

People who are interested in purchasing websites as well as publishers who wish to carry out content audits will find this option to be extremely beneficial.

Because the prices offered by the company are so unbelievably reasonable (as you will see in the following section), even a big website with 1,000 blog entries that are each 2,000 words long would only have to spend $400 for a full website scan.

### Filter for the quality

In spite of the fact that I have only tested a small number of articles so far, I have noticed that the content that I consider to be my strongest consistently receives very high scores for its degree of originality.

Even if the content was not generated by AI, articles that are repetitive and dull receive lower originality scores. scores that are above average but not exceptional in between.

The results thus far indicate that it is a filter of satisfactory quality. As a result of the fact that you can onboard a team, you can mandate that your writers make use of it.

### Predictor of search engine rankings

I haven't conducted a sufficient number of tests to determine whether or not this software can accurately forecast whether or not material will, but I will be conducting experiments this week.

When I say this, what I mean is that I want to determine whether or not the articles that generate the most traffic from my site consistently receive high originality scores, and whether or not the content that does not perform well receives low originality scores. This software has the potential to be utilized as a predictor of ranks and traffic if, after extensive testing, it is found to produce the desired results.

This would have an incredible amount of power.

## Originality Pricing

The wonderful news just keeps on coming. It will cost you $.01 for every 100 words. You pay as you go (my fave pricing for software). Ten cents will get you an article of one thousand words. If you discover that this provides good quality control for your site, then in my opinion, that is a very small price to pay.

## Originality AI Pros & Cons Pros

You simply need to copy and paste your material into the box, and it will immediately provide you with a score.

Originality was the only one of the AI Content Detectors on the market that passed my tests.

AI was by far the most accurate of all the tools (for an example, see the image in the part below titled "Originality.AI Alternatives").

The prices are really reasonable. For instance, the base plan of Surfer SEO includes coverage for around 240,000 words per year at a cost of $588 per year. Using Originality. It would cost 24 dollars for AI to detect content that was generated by AI and had the same word count.

### Cons

You won't be given any insight into which parts of your content the technology identified as including AI because it doesn't provide that information. The value would skyrocket if the tool highlighted areas where there was room for development.

The authors do not disclose any of the criteria that are used to determine whether or not to flag the content. In the case study part that follows, you'll find that I was able to do some reverse engineering on it, but there's not much transparency behind their approach.

There is no capability to perform benchmarking. It would be useful to display, along with the search results, any other AI-generated content that was present, along with the content scores that corresponded to it.

## Originality AI Alternatives

The following is the headline that was used for AI's press release: "...The First AI Tool Available to Detect [Content Created by Popular AI Writing](https://devinschumacher.com/best/ai-writing-software/) Tools." In spite of this, several new competitors have entered the market in recent years.

I examined and tested all of them in our best AI content detectors post. Originality.

AI provided the best findings, although another tool (Content at Scale‚Äôs AI Detector) had reasonable accuracy:

There are also numerous of plagiarism checkers on the market, therefore I‚Äôll go through them here too!

### AI Content Detectors

#### Content at Scale AI Detector

Content at Scale is an AI content generating service that produces full-length, SEO-optimized blog articles in a few clicks without human intervention.

Given that they focus on providing content that can pass AI detection tests, they have a vested interest in creating an accurate AI detection tool, and make it available on their website for everyone to use. As far as free tools go, it‚Äôs fairly excellent.

Overall, it was the second-most accurate tool in our tests. It‚Äôs free, but limits you to roughly 400 words. Still, it‚Äôs useful for evaluating short-form stuff like HARO query replies.

#### Copyleaks AI Content Detector

Copyleaks offers a whole range of services to help [content marketers](https://devinschumacher.com/what-is-content-marketing/), agencies, and enterprises develop and manage high-quality content. They constructed their own AI content detector, possibly as a lead generation tool.

While the tool wasn‚Äôt very accurate in our testing, it is the only free tool with no word count constraints.

### Plagiarism Checkers

#### Grammarly

Grammarly is one of my favorite writing tools and delivers fantastic grammatical and language suggestions. They also give a plagiarism checker within their product.

Grammarly‚Äôs premium offerings, which include their plagiarism detector, start at $12/month. It‚Äôs more expensive than Originality. AI yet delivers a whole distinct set of features.

#### Copyscape

Copyscape is the world‚Äôs most prominent plagiarism checker. Many freelance writing job advertisements will require writers to check for plagiarism using Copyscape.

Copyscape costs 3 cents for the first 200 words and 1 cent for every 100 words beyond that. The pricing is basically the same as Originality. AI, other from the extra payment for the first 200 words.

#### Surfer SEO

Surfer SEO is a data-driven tool that helps web publishers develop optimal content for SEO. The company‚Äôs defining feature is a 0-100 SEO score, which rates content quality and relevancy for a particular keyword. They also offer a [keyword research](https://devinschumacher.com/keyword-research//) tool, a ‚Äúgrow flow‚Äù option, and a SERP analyzer.

Surfer includes a free plagiarism detector within their subscription. Their standard package costs $59/month, with a savings if you prepaid annually. Like Grammarly, it‚Äôs more pricey than Originality. AI but delivers another distinct set of features.

## Conclusion / TLDR

Most of the time, the tool tells the right tale and detects AI material, nevertheless, it can be misled.

You probably only should interrogate writers if many works have been detected by the technology.

However, let‚Äôs be honest. Most AI-generated content doesn‚Äôt have much thought behind it and will probably get uncovered.

The fact that this is workable at a small scale as a SAAS tool doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs sustainable for Google in terms of costs and value, especially considering the fair rate of false positives.

Nonetheless, if you combine this to the fact that OpenAI is working on a watermark system for AI material, this can lead us to question the long-term viability of the new ‚Äúprogrammatic SEO‚Äù trend.
