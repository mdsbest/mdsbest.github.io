Whenever you were amazed by a marvelous poster on a billboard or a beautiful Instagram post, did you ever wonder whether it was possible to create such material for yourself?

The answer is an easy, big "yes!" Such an app or site does exist.

Multiple services offer the ability to create the best graphics for yourself or your own business. Market competition has become extremely fierce, though, so how can you make the best possible choice?

Professionals of all sorts agree that it's wise to choose Snappa to create the best and most professional-looking content without breaking the bank. This Snappa review will cover everything you need to know about this brilliant graphic design software!

## What is Snappa?

[Snappa](https://serp.ly/snappa/) is one of the leading photo editing programs for non-designers (people who don't edit or design professionally).

Whether you want to design a poster for your college event, develop thumbnails, make an advertisement post for your startup, or post on social media accounts, Snappa can be your go-to great photo editor.

Previously, companies or individuals looking to work with graphics had a hard time searching for the right designer or had to learn complicated tools like [Adobe Photoshop](https://serp.ly/photoshop/). Now, you can sign up for Snappa and use their extensive library of templates and royalty-free images to kickstart all your needs.

Services like Snappa can be beneficial for personal or professional purposes, including digital marketing, campaigns on social media channels, and more. The brand's tagline ("create online graphics in a snap") couldn't be more accurate.

The vibrant and easy-to-understand intuitive user interface Snappa makes creating graphics of all kinds easier than ever; the site gives you all the features you need to create something that represents you, your brand, and your goals.

Additionally, you have full control over the pricing plans and packages that best suit your needs.

Unlike many other resources, Snappa seamlessly integrates with the social media platforms, allowing you to export images and post with ease. Snappa reviews are a testimony of the well-loved nature of this tool.

## Snappa Pricing Options

![](/images/how-much-snappa.png)

To decide between Snappa vs.any other graphics editor, one of the deciding factors often is pricing. Unfortunately, not all individuals or businesses have the ability to pay expensive programs or program fees, but that doesn't mean it's impossible to find a graphics designer tool that works well.

As highlighted on the brand's website, Snappa pricing is straightforward. In addition, every new user that signs up for Snappa begins with a free account with no credit card required.

As per your personal requirements, you can choose any plan. Snappa cost and pricing break down into three distinct plan options:

### Starter Plan

It is the free version of Snappa, which gives free access to one user.

This plan gives the user the freedom to choose from free samples of 6000+ templates and 5,000,000 HD photos and graphics, but limits to only 3 downloads a month.

This plan can be ideal for those who do not use graphic design software very frequently. A free user can still access many of the benefits Snappa offers - create amazing gifs, for instance, or design an engaging Twitter header - without financial commitment.

### Pro Plan

On the low end of the Snappa pricing model, this plan is priced at 15$ a month for one user. Like the starter plan, it allows the user to access plenty of innovative and cool templates and 5,000,000 royalty-free stock photos. 

It also includes other features not found in the starter plan, including social media integration, custom font uploads, and the magical background remover tool.

The best part? You can make unlimited downloads in a month! Unfortunately, free users will not be able to take advantage of such features.

### Team Plan

The team plan allows for team collaboration of up to 5 users priced at $30 per month. This option includes the same premium features as the pro plan. 

The features of team collaboration will be discussed late, but for now, it's safe to say this is the best plan for startups/online small businesses for a seamless team-sharing experience.

As mentioned, all the photos and graphics in Snappa are 100% royalty-free. That means that these images can be used for both commercial and non-commercial purposes; no fees, no copyright arguments, and no fuss.

## Shortcomings Of Snappa 

![](/images/snappa-no-flaws.png)

Each individual or company has its own requirements for a particular tool. This could be based on the size of the company, the business model, or the customers it caters to.

While Snappa is a great tool, certain Snappa reviews highlight certain shortcomings that you need to consider before committing to it. Examples include:

- **Lack of advanced features:** This tool is primarily for beginner graphic designers since it has very few advanced features. For those looking for more complex and sophisticated software, Snappa may not make the mark. For example - if the SVG format suited somebody, they may not be able to find that at Snappa.
- **Need for the internet:** Snappa is an online graphic design software connected to the cloud. All users must be connected to the internet since there is no scope for offline work. 
- **Accessibility:** Snappa cannot be used on smartphones, which limits ease of access. 
- **Comparison to others:** Since the templates are accessible to all users, it may be so that many people are using similar or very static templates. It may reduce originality and uniqueness. 
- **Less extra customization:** Unlike [Canva](https://serp.ly/canva/), [Snappa](https://serp.ly/snappa/) does not offer badge graphics or stickers.
