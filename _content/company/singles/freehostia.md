Freehostia provides its customers with a variety of hosting plans, with free and paid choices being available. Customers are able to select the plan that is the most suitable for their requirements as well as their financial situation because the plans offer varying amounts of features and resources.

The free hosting plan offered by Freehostia comes with up to five email accounts, 6 gigabytes of monthly bandwidth, and a storage space of 250 megabytes. Even though it has fewer resources than other plans, this one is a suitable choice for people who are just getting started with a website or have low levels of traffic.

Freehostia provides many paid hosting options for users who require more resources than those offered by the free plan. The "Chocolate" plan has a starting price of $2.95 per month and offers up to 15 email accounts, unlimited storage space, and bandwidth, as well as a free domain name. 

The "Cinnamon" plan starts at $6.95 per month and contains all of the features that are included in the "Chocolate" plan, in addition to priority customer service and the opportunity to host up to 50 websites.

Freehostia also provides VPS hosting and dedicated server alternatives for customers who require a higher level of control and access to a greater number of resources. These plans are more expensive than shared hosting plans, but they offer dedicated resources and superior performance.

The following is a markdown table that provides a summary of Freehostia's hosting plans and pricing:

## Domain Names

FreeHostia's Wildhoney and Supernatural plans do, in fact, provide with complimentary domain name registration. You have the option of spending between $9.95 and $10.95 a year to acquire a domain ending in.com,.net,.org,.info, etc. These are on the more affordable end of the scale. In contrast to GoDaddy, they do not regularly raise the prices of their domain names. However, I find it most convenient to purchase all of my domain names through Namecheap due to the fact that they are incredibly affordable and simple to work with.

## FreeHostia Uptime & Performance

### Uptime

How reliable is FreeHostia's server uptime, exactly?

There is an uptime guarantee offered by FreeHostia, which can be found in their terms of service.  There is a guarantee that their servers will be operational 99.9 percent of the time.  They guarantee that you will receive notification of any scheduled maintenance 24 hours in advance.  There is a possibility that you will experience downtime whenever they are undertaking maintenance.  

On the other hand, there is no information regarding what will occur if their uptime drops below 99.9%.

According to the findings of the research, there have been issues with uptime.  On WebHostingReviews.com, we've heard this from a few different customers' perspectives.

### Performance

How reliable is FreeHostia as a hosting provider?

There are various FreeHostia plans that do make use of solid-state drive (SSD) hard drives. They do use cloud hosting for certain of their plans, which is beneficial to the performance of such plans. We carried out several tests that demonstrate how quickly their servers respond from the following locations:

<table><tbody><tr><td>Los Angeles</td><td>56.55 ms</td></tr><tr><td>Dallas</td><td>27.95 ms</td></tr><tr><td>New York</td><td>21.92 ms</td></tr><tr><td>Singapore</td><td>222.18 ms</td></tr><tr><td>London</td><td>93.33 ms</td></tr><tr><td>Amsterdam</td><td>106.77 ms</td></tr><tr><td>San Francisco</td><td>55.99 ms</td></tr></tbody></table>

The average amount of time it takes for your name server, dns1.freehostia.com, to respond after 9 lookups is 83.53 milliseconds.

There are also several tests that show metrics on how rapidly their website responds, and these include the following:

<table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Loading Time</td><td>First Byte</td><td>Start Render</td><td>Speed Index</td></tr><tr><td>First View</td><td>2.372s</td><td>0.396s</td><td>1.006s</td><td>1825</td></tr><tr><td>Repeat View</td><td>1.493s</td><td>0.433s</td><td>1.001s</td><td>1399</td></tr></tbody></table>

According to the findings of the research, performance is not likely to be an issue with FreeHostia. I was unable to uncover much information on people griping about the poor performance of FreeHostia, which was frustrating.

## Conclusion

Is FreeHostia a web host that we can recommend? No. Is it safe to assume that they are a terrible host as a result? No. First and foremost, we appreciate that all of their plans come with with cloud hosting. This is a useful and appealing feature. Their rates are comparable to those offered by other hosts. However, the customer service department did not even attempt to respond to my message. Additionally, it has been mentioned on other websites that there is no customer support available. Because of this, we are unable to provide a recommendation for FreeHostia at this moment as we await additional input on the company.
