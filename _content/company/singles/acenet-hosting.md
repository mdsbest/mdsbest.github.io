Your website will be accessible 99.9% of the time, according to Acenet. Customers report that the real-life figures are 99.9%, even though there is no evidence to support this claim on the web. 

It's possible that alternative web hosts can present you with somewhat better numbers if you're concerned about that 0.03% - 0.04 %. Acenet also offers third-party reports on server performance and CPU live data through cPanel, both of which are provided by Acenet. 

Finally, Acenet offers to restore your money 99.9% of the time if your website's metrics show that it isn't working properly, which lends confidence to the company.

### Features

Some of Acenet's features will surprise you. Among its many infinite services are web storage, bandwidth, domain hosting, MySQL databases, and a slew of other options. 

An additional benefit for eCommerce-focused startups is the inclusion of a dedicated IP address as well as a free domain name. One-click installation and interesting business apps are not to be overlooked.

- Multiple Domains: Acenet has no restrictions on the number of domains and subdomains you can host. You know, it's cool, huh?

- Bandwidth: Acenet does not track or limit user bandwidth, so you are free to send as much data as you like across the network.

- Disk Space: There is no limit to the amount of data you may save on our servers.

- Email Accounts: Email addresses ending in @yourdomain.com are unrestricted. This is fantastic!

- Website Builder: SiteStudio is available, although it's a little dated.

- Stats: AWStats, a feature of cPanel, may be utilized.

- Shopping Carts: It's possible to choose between CubeCart, Zen Cart, and OS Commerce, among others.

- FTP Account: As for FTP accounts, there are no restrictions whatsoever. There is no limit to how many you can make. 

- MySQL databases: The same goes for everything else. It's possible to host as numerous MySQL databases as you like on your server.

### Support

As for customer service, Acenet does not provide live chat help; nevertheless, if you contact the support staff by phone or email, they will respond within 15 minutes. 

The pre-sale section of the company may be contacted for information about signing up, plans, rates, and so on. Acenet has also built a comprehensive knowledge resource to help beginners grasp web hosting.

- Phone support

- No available 24/7 phone support

- No available blog

- Support for pre-sale customers

- No available forum

- Quick response

- Extensive database of knowledge

- No available Live Chat

### Dedicated Hosting Plan

Acenet's enterprise-grade dedicated server solutions offer the best of both worlds in terms of server power and bandwidth. Remote KVM, Remote Power, and IPMI 2.0 are all included as standard equipment in all of our server plans. This ensures that your servers will run at peak efficiency and dependability. 

All-in-one plans start at $147/month and include 3 TB of capacity on RAID 1 disks, and 16 GB of server-grade ECC memory, with 10 terabits-per-second transfer speeds. 

For a monthly fee of $239.95, you get two Intel Xeon E5 2600 series processors, 3 TB of space, 32 GB of server-grade RAM, with 10 TB of bandwidth on the plan. These programs are extremely cost-effective. Even though we would like to see more plans with additional capacity for the most demanding customers, these servers should perform fine for most users.

### WordPress Hosting Plan

All major CMS systems, including WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal, are supported by Acenet's shared hosting plans. This should compensate for the lack of a dedicated and stand-alone WordPress hosting plan offered by the firm. 

However, Acenet's versatile shared hosting architecture ensures that every pre-designed or custom-designed WordPress plan will run well on Acenet's servers. 

It's becoming more and more common for reputable web hosts to exclude WordPress hosting from their most basic plans because of their focus on efficiency, user interface, and user experience (UI/UX).

### Reseller Hosting Plan

Acenet's reseller hosting services are ideal for web development and design studios wishing to provide hosting as part of their pre-configured packages. There are no restrictions on pricing or resource allocations for these services because they are white labeled. 

Using the WebHost Manager Control interface, you can easily and conveniently manage all of your dedicated client accounts and services from a single UI page. 

On the reseller plan, which costs $59.95 a month, each user can have about 150 cPanel accounts and 150 GB of storage capacity on an elevated SSD. This reseller plan offers excellent value for money since it is far less expensive than the alternative reseller accounts competing for hosting services. 

It is also possible to create as many subdomains, email addresses, and FTP accounts as you like on a reseller plan. R1Soft CDP distant backup solutions are used to protect reseller accounts, which are housed on servers running the 64-bit CentOS 5 operating system.

### User Friendly

They provide a user-friendly website that makes it easy to find the web hosting you seek in a matter of minutes. You'll have no trouble navigating the site and discovering what you're searching for. 

A bespoke cPanel and the SiteStudio website builder are included on every Acenet plan. However, you should be aware that its website builder features obsolete designs and capabilities, so you'll likely need to invest additional money to produce a nice, modern-looking website using its service. 

## Pros

- Unlimited features

- Freebie domain name

- Includes a dedicated IP

- Exceptional one-click set-up

- Quality gear that's always up to date

- Planning with a lot of leeway

## Cons

- Costs are higher

- Non-availability of live chat and 24-hour phone assistance

- A mediocre platform for website builders

Acenet has a nice appearance. The storage and monthly traffic, MySQL databases, domains, email and FTP accounts, and so forth are all limitless. 

Everything you need for a successful online project may be found in their trustworthy hardware and a wide range of one-click installation choices. Despite this, Acenet has several drawbacks, including exorbitant costs and difficulties in contacting customer service.

## Customer Feedback

“I just wanted to add my support to the previous reviewer's enthusiasm. In the five years, I've collaborated with Acenet, I've probably sent more than 100 support tickets. Even on Sunday nights or very late weeknights, my questions have always been resolved within 5 - 10 minutes! All of my issues with the product or service have been resolved by individuals who have gone above and beyond to help me. Even outside of the web hosting sector, this level of assistance is unheard of. I've only had downtime twice in the last five years or so. I've never been very concerned about it. Considering that I get 500 GB of web space, unlimited bandwidth, limitless domains (yes, you read that correctly), unlimited SQL databases, etc. for less than $100 a year, this is a great value for me. Customer support alone would not persuade me to transfer to a different web server. This business is deserving of praise. ” - Chas Denonno 

“I've been using Ace-Host since 2007 and want to continue doing so. They've always responded quickly, had techs who were educated (for the most part), and were able to help me with just about any problem I've run across. For the services they provide, their costs are reasonable. Never had a moment to myself.” - Sean Stuart

## Conclusion

There are a few areas where Acenet falls short, such as the unavailability of live chat and phone assistance for shared hosting subscriptions. Small and medium-sized organizations may find it adequate, but people on a budget may be discouraged by the costs. 

Small individual websites and large worldwide web projects alike can benefit from [Acenet's](https://serp.ly/acenet) various capabilities. You'll get everything you need to run a profitable web hosting business, including high-quality hardware, a user-friendly cPanel, and reliable uptime. However, this web host's rates and lackluster customer service may cause you to second-guess your decision.
