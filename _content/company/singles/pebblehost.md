## PebbleHost Walkthrough

[PebbleHost](https://serp.ly/pebblehost) first joined the field of online gaming in 2017 and currently provides a ton of hosting services to customers in over 150 countries, with hundreds of servers worldwide and monthly consumption of over two petabytes.

PebbleHost is a game server provider (GSP) that offers bare metal and virtual private server (VPS) hosting for the most demanding gaming applications, such as Minecraft server and other sandbox games. They also have fantastic support Discord bot hosting.

PebbleHost began by investing in OVHcloud's Canadian datacenter's hard-disk-based "So you Start" dedicated servers. They quickly updated to servers with ultra-fast SSDs and the latest processors and components, adding additional resources in one of its data centers in France.

PebbleHost afterward expanded its reach to OVHcloud's Sydney datacenter as part of their continuous expansion program, choosing an excellent server performance from the current range: Advance.

PebbleHost can come in at 80% less than the market on the game server provider market while providing the same (or better) great customer and end-user service, given to their ongoing partnership with OVHcloud. Pebblehost platform company offers Minecraft server hosting, Game hosting, Discord bot hosting, Web hosting, and Dedicated Servers hosting.

The website's interface is crisp, has a pretty fantastic color combination. Since I am a gamer, I know how hard it is to keep everything smooth while playing. The game console itself can fetch an incredible amount of data, and ping needs to be taken care of since most of it needs to run online.

And Pebblehost's reviews are excellent, which means they can provide whatever they offer. Plus, they have vast data centers, majorly in Europe and North American hosting locations. Pebblehost ensures that their customers enjoy industry-level hardware, subdomain creator, timely support, java8 support, and task scheduling, all at no added costs.

According to Google searches, PebbleHost provides a 100% uptime on all of their plans, day or night. To keep services online, no overselling, so they keep their node stats transparent and public. You can find their live node status in this link: 100 percent uptime node stats.

They also offer a custom control panel to suit the need of the company or the business, their unbeatable pricing while providing premium hardware technology, highly-reviewed among other competitors, and a dedicated support team located in the United Kingdom, the United States.

Excellent decent support reviews swept me here, and I'd like to experience if it's all a hoax or if the reviews are accurate. This information is from a Trustpilot, a professional, and has reputable, outstanding surveys that most tech-savvy individuals leave for others to see. You can see that Pebblehost ranked, Excellent with a whopping 4.6 points.

## Getting Started With Pebblehost

There are a bunch of cheap and yet great of a deal to get started on [Pebblehost](https://serp.ly/pebblehost). There is a lack of words to describe how this hosting company can offer an excellent uptime and the lowest downtime percentage.

It is essential while not comprising its quality—the cheapest among all of the other Minecraft good server hosting companies that I have experienced. I will make screenshots and tell you honestly how the company hosts at a high-level level, without any bias. So far, I am impressed.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iIDJfzvMD04zt8c82DZDhIDmUUiAndkrm-AG3H2-Eu9x_0Xid6i9yyO6Py7bhADS3_-4wkgG2iIUZjesBHjy0F8OgUf5R_xZMVcUqvfyy9GtuDGmX4th2yTvclqFHD5hCNwv-MtytTzN_Xix_vPdEiw)

For this hosting review, I will choose the Premium Minecraft Server Hosting Product Tier. Intel i9-9900K / Xeon E-2236 @ 4.8Ghz, DDR4 2666MHz Memory, unmetered Enterprise-Grade NVMe SSDs, 480Gbps DDoS Protection, unlimited Slots, has One-click Modpack Installer and free Automatic Backups and has North American, European & Australian data centers, respectively.

There is a scalable slider to handpick a plan, which is impressive and simple to operate by people who need higher RAM. There are drop-down options for the "I'm not sure" selection if you cannot find or have not yet decided on what's best for you.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/pYN40-xyOCkJlijq0hicfxU6W9YG1LketxGwPMP-scD_7jtdCOeOnLlBTQ716fwXGLT7SzaQw-kNLovDYMG1r3hQUZ-MW8UT_l5E9-Sw3AYXp0Vgh4Mdl0fqIHh98VRuiL7KreaGRefGUyyZJIhrJsM)

After adding the plan to the cart, They directed me to this page.

This page lets you know what you are buying from them, the features, and how much the total service cost will be, so you can compare prices before checking out. They also have an option where you can choose your billing cycle. It also offers vast server IP choices, which has a bit of location info for your host server at the beginning. If you are unsure what to select, they have some suggestions which have excellent performance on perspective. Here in the figure below, they showed that Australia has the best ping.

Assuming that you will also need to set up your IP, they will let you know their recommended settings and database mods or plugins so you won't have to stop and ensure that you can finish your purchase.

If you are expecting the worst of the worst, you can avail yourself of extra protection for your server and or connections, which can charge you an additional cost, but it's optional. I continue to the next page, where I need to input my account details to manage my hosting server. 

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/puEG5O7oEEzO_PDiQcs5FV1pEZHNM8ahKuFvsHWljxEnPzKvrin4gMnZor0AmYiO-c14jL3YeHb5xct3QlSFlexryOyY9r2dHJrSum_WMP5UngQAPmSCcsmOKXWLNlJd8J1Ud8nEV4kBv61c4Qdu-n0)
