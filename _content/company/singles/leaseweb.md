## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- A large number of products. Whereas some suppliers simply give names and hosting programs, Leaseweb offers a wide range of products. Almost any web service is available under their umbrella. Isn't it incredible?

- 99.9999 percent uptime is guaranteed. Leaseweb guarantees 99.9999 percent uptime, in which it means your website will be unavailable for no more than 5 minutes per year.

- Data Centers Around the World. Leaseweb offers one of the most extensive global footprints of any service provider I've examined so far. It operates 15 datacenters around the world. Please read the list in this Leaseweb review page under the Server location.

- Customer service that is genuinely helpful. As I indicated above, the service offers four methods of help to their customers: ticket, email, phone, and live chat. It has the best support crew I've ever encountered. My preferred method of communication with them is through their live chat assistance. They answer your enquiry in seconds and provide assistance that is tailored to your specific needs.

### Cons

- No Refund. Most businesses offer at least a 30-day money-back guarantee to alleviate their clients' anxieties about their hard-earned money. Leaseweb, on the other hand, does not offer such a guarantee to its consumers. Rather, several customers have complained that the service billed them for discontinuing the service. In my opinion, they should address these issues and probably add a money-back guarantee to their services.

- Service is relatively slow. When compared with other shared hosting program providers, Leaseweb's service is relatively slow. If you're looking for too-fast shared hosting, then you should go with a company that has a good reputation in the industry.

- Annual Subscriptions are the only Available - There is no way to purchase monthly subscriptions. Despite the fact that they mention hosting pricing on a monthly basis, the sole alternative is to pay for hosting on an annual basis. This is a significant disadvantage for the service supplier.

## Conclusion

[Leaseweb](https://serp.ly/leaseweb) offers a diverse choice of items at a reasonable price. If your company requires all of its services from a single vendor, Leaseweb is the ideal option. It is without a doubt the best-dedicated web hosting for companies. It was also discovered that they are one of the world's largest hosting companies. However, difficulties such as a false product description and a yearly subscription demand are among the faults that should be addressed.
