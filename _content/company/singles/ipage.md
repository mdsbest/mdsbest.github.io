You can also see your cart, which contains your chosen plan, inclusions, and the amount to be paid. For the billing period, you can choose to pay for one, two, or three years. I was debating whether to go with the WP Essential plan or iPage's shared hosting plan but in the end, I chose the GO PLAN for this review.

Click the 'Continue to Add-ons' button to choose from the following: Website Backup and Restore for $1.00/month, SiteLock for $1.99/month, and Google Workspace.

## iPage Customer Support

iPage's customer support team is available 24/7 to assist its customer. You can reach the team via a call by using the contact number or via chat. Just click the 'Chat' button to start.

For this review, I asked if they offer free site migration from other web hosting providers. I immediately got a reply, and the answer was no; they do not offer that at all. There was, however, a group of technical support people who would perform the migration process for a fee.

My second question was if they offer any shared hosting plans on a shared hosting server, and the answer was yes. They have a GO Plan that starts at $1.99 per month if you pay for three years of the hosting service.

![SSL Certificates](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ywAClzf7KwOFoV-nMDaDIjNHhoYZtawyFdAFpLj_CWK1q7aKZ5zBQhwKd-XMC2Yq0_J2zKbtfU15tvevza1OKHYYVOITmK5ZdjPlqKCR8OplwwVVN2ycS-19NlyPgIdtNKyq45mYVQl4gI9pr0M_mjg)

## Final Thoughts

I have reviewed many web hosting service providers, and this one perhaps has the lowest starting price if you choose to pay three years in advance. Compared to other web hosts, iPage offers the smallest number of plans.

I particularly enjoyed using the free website builder; with that said, a lot of its amazing features are not for free and you will have to upgrade to use it.

In general, iPage is a recommended web host for blogs and smaller businesses. If you have a larger business, take a look at another hosting company as iPage web hosting isn't quite prepared to handle those.

Like other web hosts, iPage has an excellent tech support team that is always on the go to help iPage customers. The money-back guarantee offer was a decent one as well.

Although lacking some advanced features that are available at other web-hosting providers, it is essential to note that it has hosted successful websites many times over.

I hope this [iPage](https://serp.ly/ipage) review helped with your web hosting journey!
