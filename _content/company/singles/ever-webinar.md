Do you have a product or service you want to sell? Is what you are selling not limited by time and can be used over and over again?

If you answered yes to both of these questions, then [EverWebinar](https://serp.ly/ever-webinar) might be the right webinar software for you.

There are several different webinar platforms you can choose from, but we'll discuss why you should consider EverWebinar.

## **What is EverWebinar?**

EverWebinar is a web-based product that offers a seamlessly simple experience for conducting evergreen online and live webinars and presentations. The key here is that EverWebinar offers automated webinars that are designed to appear as if they are happening live.

This webinar experience is slightly different from a live webinar because it is meant to replicate a live webinar without it being live.

If you're looking to run a live webinar, EverWebinar's sister product, [WebinarJam](https://devinschumacher.com/review/webinarjam), is what you would want to use.

EverWebinar was ranked as one of the most popular tools by Entrepreneur Magazine in 2016, which means they have been recognized as an industry leader in their field.

It is perfect for business owners who teach their subjects, prospects, and clients on an ongoing basis, such as yoga instructors, entrepreneurs, and public speakers.

It has all the functionality you would need to host a webinar, including video and audio streaming, chat, polls, screen sharing capabilities, and more.

But, perhaps what stands out the most about this EverWebinar software is the ability to do all the work upfront and let the automation do the rest. Automated webinars give business owners, content creators, and anyone else the power to put on a webinar at any time of the day.

There is also no limit on how many people can attend your events, so this could be a great option for sales representatives who are looking to host webinars targeting larger numbers of potential customers.

With EverWebinarâ€™s powerful features and fair pricing plans, it is one of the best options on the market today.

## **Who is this EverWebinar Review For?**

This EverWebinar review is for anyone or any company that sells a product or service to prospects.

Conducting webinars is a great way to turn a cold lead into a warm lead, and the choice to either have a live, or automated webinar is entirely up to you.

Here is a small list of people who may benefit the most from using a product like EverWebinar.

- Companies that are selling a product or service to prospects and customers.
- Content creators that have an established following and are trying to sell them a particular product or service (i.e., an online course).
- An instructor or educational institution that is trying to sell a student on purchasing a course or book, for example.

If you're selling a product that isn't time-based, then conducting evergreen webinars and replaying them is a great way to generate new leads continuously. This process helps you get new leads through your webinar funnel with the sole intention of converting them into a customer.

## **EverWebinar Features**

### **Automated Webinars**

EverWebinar offers one of the best webinar tools on the market today, and it's all thanks to their automated capabilities.

As we mentioned, EverWebinar users will get the most out of this software by really taking advantage of the "set it and forget it" approach of this software.

With EverWebinar, you can put on a webinar at any time of the day without having to worry about conducting it yourself.

But, how do you do this?

To run automated webinars, all you need to do is a recording of a webinar you have already conducted in the past. If you have the video file on your computer, you can upload it to your EverWebinar in the Configuration settings and by clicking on the Source video.

Better yet, if your pre-recorded webinars are on your YouTube channel, you can take the YouTube link and use that as your automated webinar.

Once you have selected the video you would like to use as your automated webinar; you can then set the days and times you would like this webinar to play at.

A natural question you might ask yourself is when you should schedule your webinar to be automated? This great question is answered with EverWebinar's next best feature: Just-In-Time.

### **Just-In-Time**

A common frustration for people or companies hosting webinars is that someone registers for a webinar but then gets cold feet or even forgets to join it when the day and time comes. Fortunately, EverWebinar's Just-In-Time feature seeks to mitigate this problem.

When you enable the Just-In-Time feature in EverWebinar, it allows you to automate when the webinar will play based on when the subject registers for the webinar.

Let's say that Bob visits your [landing page](https://devinschumacher.com/landing-page-optimization-tools//) at 10:37 am on Sunday, but you have already set your automated webinar schedule to play only on weekdays.

With the Just-In-Time option checked in EverWebinar, it allows you to make it seem to Bob that a webinar is about to start in a few minutes. If Bob registers for your webinar and knows that it will begin shortly, he is much more likely to stay and watch it.

Bob is also much more likely to register for the webinar if he knows that he can watch it sooner rather than later.

### **Email Marketing Automation**

If you schedule more automated webinars in EverWebinar, you might find it challenging to keep up with ensuring people attend your webinar.

EverWebinar helps you out with this bandwidth issue by offering you more automation! To help you with marketing and reminding your customers about an upcoming webinar, you can leverage EverWebinar's email marketing.

With this automation tool, you can set up reminder emails to be sent to whoever registers for your automated or live webinar. As you can see in the screenshot above, you can even send out multiple email reminders.

Another big benefit of automating your emails is that you can also automate emails to go out after the webinar is over. This can be particularly handy to have if a webinar finishes at an inconvenient time for you and you may not have the time to follow up with webinar attendees properly.

For people that registered for the webinar but did not attend, you can send them a gentle nudge to watch a replay of the webinar.

If you plan on running many of your evergreen webinars over the week, be sure to leverage this helpful feature. You might find that these email reminders help with the attendance of your live webinar or even your automated webinars!

### **3rd-Party App Integrations**

If you're not familiar with sending out automated [emails or you already have a different email service](https://devinschumacher.com/email-marketing-tools-services/) provider set up, you can use a host of different 3rd party app integrations with EverWebinar.

These 3rd party apps aren't necessarily [email marketing](https://devinschumacher.com/review/email-marketing-ian-stanley/) platforms as there are also app integrations such as Zapier. However, a good portion of these app integrations is email platforms.

People may opt to integrate with a 3rd party app because they may already have their database of contacts there.

Another powerful feature of these app integrations is the "if this, then that" function. If you're not familiar with it, you can (you guessed it!) automate the process so a certain action will lead to a certain result. Take a look at how this works below.

With the Kartra integrated with EverWebinar, you can command this integration to take a certain action once a trigger action has been completed. For example, if someone registers for a webinar, the result will be to subscribe that registrant to the "Registrants" list.

This autoresponder sequence can be a powerful tool for you because you can segment your list based on their behavior. For example, people that registered for a webinar and attended might be placed on a different list than those who registered but did not attend.

The implication of this is that both customers might be placed into a different webinar funnel from each other. Nonetheless, if you have a CRM or email service provider where your contacts are located, check to see if it integrates with EverWebinar.

### **Fully Customizable Webinar Registration Page Templates**

To get people to attend your pre-recorded webinars, you'll need to have a registration page in place. Having a webinar registration is crucial because it allows you to see how many people have signed up for the event.

There are a few ways you can set up your registration page. First, if you already own your website, you can create a webinar registration page there.

If you don't have a website or perhaps, you prefer to have the experience, from start to end, done on one platform, EverWebinar offers you that flexibility.

EverWebinar has a wide array of registration page templates for you to choose from. You can simply choose a template that you're looking for and customize the images and text within the template so that it has the look and feel of your brand.

If you're not sure which registration page template to use, EverWebinar even gives you a choice to do a split test between two different pages. A split test is where you use two registration pages at the same time - 50% of the traffic will go to one page while the other 50% will go to the other page.

This will help you keep track of which page does better at generating webinar registrations.

If you do choose to use one of EverWebinar's registration page templates, the page will be hosted on their cloud-based server. This service is included in the EverWebinar paid plan and comes at no extra charge.

### **Leveraging Urgency Through Active Offers**

If you've ever watched QVC or any type of infomercial where a particular product is being sold, you might be able to pinpoint some common strategies.

One of the most common sales techniques is to use a sense of urgency and scarcity.

You can leverage both urgency and scarcity in your EverWebinar if you plan on selling a product during your webinar. You can use both of these tactics by saying you're only going to be offering a certain number of your product at a certain price and only for a certain amount of time. Here is how it would work:

This is called Active Offer in EverWebinar, and it lets you have this pop-up during your webinar. This is an excellent way to "strike while the iron is hot." You've already gotten them to attend your webinar and the best time to close a deal is when their attention is at its highest point.

Leveraging the Active Offer in your webinar room is very easy to do, and people using EverWebinar should take advantage of it.

It provides a unique and creative way to make money. If you constantly host an evergreen webinar, the Active Offer can remain the same in every webinar because it will use those powerful sales techniques of urgency and scarcity.

### **Fixed Webinar Attendees vs.Dynamic Attendee**

The thing about live webinars is that you generally have a good idea that it is a live event. With an automated recording, some people might be able to tell that they're watching a recording.

The fixed attendee and dynamic attendee options can help out with this issue.

This function allows you to be able to simulate a webinar's attendance as if it were happening live. Oftentimes, in live webinars, people might be slow to join, and then the attendance might peak at around the halfway mark and then start to decrease as it gets closer to its conclusion.

With the Dynamic Attendee display setting turned on, EverWebinar will employ artificial intelligence to mimic this attendance pattern!

If you don't want to enable this engaging feature, you can always opt to choose either don't display or fixed attendees.

Fixed attendees will just show the people that join the webinar a pre-determined number of attendees in the webinar.

The Dynamic and Fixed Attendee option is good to have because if only one live person joins this webinar, it will appear to them that other people are also in the webinar. This is important because if someone is the only person to be on a webinar and it shows that they are the only attendee, there's a good chance that they might just leave the webinar right away.

If you want to avoid showing any attendees at all, you can select the Don't Display option.

### **Other Notable EverWebinar Features**

EverWebinar offers many great features that allow people to create automated webinars. We've covered the very best features in detail, but here are some other features you can expect.

**Hybrid Webinars (Live Chat)**

There's a difference between webinars that are live and automated webinars. One of those differences is the response time of messages during live webinars. Usually, questions are answered right away during the webinar itself.

That can be a challenge to answer a live message or question during an automated webinar, but the hybrid webinar feature solves this. It enables people to respond to messages in real-time via the live chat function in the webinar even though a person is watching a pre-recorded webinar!

For example, if someone types in a question in the chat area in the webinar, you or someone else on your team can answer that message in real-time without having to be in the actual webinar room itself.

This further makes it appear that it is a live webinar session and that someone is in the room to answer the questions!

**Live Chat Simulator**

If you're unable to answer a question from a webinar, the next best thing might be to create your live chat and import it into your automated webinar.

By importing it into your webinar, you're telling EverWebinar to play a chat as if it is happening in real-time. This automated chat feature gives off the appearance that your webinar is live and isn't a recording!

This is a great way to give off the appearance of higher engagement and energy throughout a webinar. If a webinar you held in the past had significantly more activity in the live chat feature, you can take that conversation and import it to your automated webinars.

Alternatively, you can also create your own "script" and have it roll out at certain timestamps in your automated webinar.

**Polls and Surveys**

Polls and surveys are a fantastic way to keep your webinar attendees engaged with your webinar. Including a poll, survey, or even a quiz makes your presentation more interactive and is a good way to see if your audience is paying attention to the webinar!

**Webinar Analytics**

One of the most important things you'll want to keep track of from your automated webinars is your analytics.

This webinar tool is helpful for anyone that puts on an automated webinar because it presents you with pertinent data such as how many people registered, who attended, and what percentage stuck around for the entire webinar.

This data is important because it will not only provide you with data, but you can also take that data and optimize your webinar to achieve the outcomes you're looking for.

**Multiple Presenters and Screen Sharing**

If you're hosting a webinar with another colleague or perhaps a guest, EverWebinar allows for multiple people to present during the webinar. If you or your guest are presenting a PowerPoint presentation, the screen sharing function will allow you to share your presentation on the webinar.

### **EverWebinar Drawbacks**

It's hard to find any type of software that is perfect, and the same can be said for EverWebinar.

As we've seen in this Everwebinar review, it does come with many great features, but there are also some drawbacks. Here are the most glaring issues we found.

**No Free Trial**

The lack of a free trial might make people think twice about using EverWebinar. The 14-day, $1 trial might be enticing to some people, but others may simply be uncomfortable with submitting their payment information.

We should also point that the EverWebinar platform is not cheap by any means either, especially if you're paying on a month-to-month basis.

**No Breakout Rooms**

One of the best features of live webinars is the breakout room feature. This feature allows cohorts of attendees to break off into smaller groups to discuss a given topic.

Once the discussion is over, these small groups would rejoin the main group, and the live webinar would resume.

Unfortunately, EverWebinar is a fully automated webinar funnels software that does not have this capability simply because the webinar is not live. Thus, a robust side discussion in smaller groups is not possible with EverWebinar.

**No Live Webinars**

As you probably already know by now, EverWebinar is strictly an automated webinar platform. It does not offer the ability to put on live events. This can be a dealbreaker for many people who want to only broadcast live webinars.

A solution to this is to check out EverWebinar's sister product, WebinarJam, which only allows users to run live webinars. Both [video conferencing platforms](https://devinschumacher.com/video-platforms/) are owned by parent company Genesis Digital, and so you're likely to expect a similar experience with WebinarJam but for live events.

**Weak Analytics**

As great as it is to have webinar analytics in EverWebinar, it lacks in the data it provides users. For example, if you notice that your webinar has 100 people in the webinar room at the same time, but you only notice that 5 people are left when it ends, you might want to know roughly when people starting dropping off.

This is just one example where more can be asked for in the analytics in EverWebinar.

### **EverWebinar Pricing**

For a customizable and tailored, automated webinar experience, you might be surprised to find out that the EverWebinar pricing is very reasonable.

As you can see, there are three different paid plans you can choose from. If you're not sure about whether you want to use EverWebinar long-term, you can opt to pay on a month-to-month basis with their Monthly Plan.

At $99 per month, the Monthly Plan is the steepest in terms of price. If you do foresee yourself using this automated [webinar software](https://devinschumacher.com/webinar-software/) long-term, the Biennial Plan offers the best value at $34 per month.

All plans come with a 30-day money-back guarantee, and you can cancel anytime during this 30-day window.

One thing we did notice was that as we were leaving this pricing page, we were hit with an enticing pop-up offer for a substantial discount on a 14-day trial.

This might be a limited-time type of offer, but for those who are on the fence about EverWebinar, a dollar to try this for 2 weeks might be a good bet.
