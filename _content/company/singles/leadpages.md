## What isÂ Leadpages?

Well, to put it simply,Â [Leadpages](https://serp.ly/leadpages/)Â is certainly one of the most popular landing page builders on the entire Internet. Itâ€™s perfect for medium and small-sized businesses.

Leadpages calls itself â€˜the most effective way for a small business to connect with an audience and close new sales.â€™ I could not think of a better way to describe the platform in a nutshell.

Leadpages allows users to build beautiful landing pages with popup and alert features to connect with their audience and get more sales.

But now, at this stage, I know exactly what you're thinking. You're thinking that Leadpages is just like every single other landing page platform on the market, including the ones that we've already written reviews for.

But that's not the case, there are features the Leadpages have, which proves that it has earned its right to be talked about amongst the best platforms in the industry.

So in this review, we're going to take a look at where the platform is awesome, and where it's just a tad overrated.

What makes Leadpages so great, is that it is made for businesses of all kinds.

Regardless of whether you're a multinational corporation with clients all around the world, or just a small online business still finding its roots, Leadpages has the tools and support that you need to craft your landing pages the exact way you want.

Leadpages helps more than 45,000 users to turn their dream of creating an online business into a reality.

There is a perfect blend between the simplistic nature of building landing pages and advanced features. Such as the in-depth analytics and HTML coding options, meaning Leadpages has hit the perfect sweet spot between appealing to beginner entrepreneurs while being robust enough to guide larger businesses in creating landing pages too.

## Leadpages Features

### Landing Pages Builder + Drag and Drop Editor

Starting with the main feature of the Leadpages platform, the landing page builder is where the magic happens. Its extremely user-friendly design allows anyone to start customizing landing pages using the templates explained below.

Using the drag and drop editor is simple! All you have to do is click on any element of the page to allow the customization options to appear. From here, you've got complete freedom as to what you want to do with it and how you want your landing pages to look.

You can easily add more elements as well. Drag and drop from the options on the side of the page and then begin editing the way you like. You line

Overall, it's a pretty intuitive platform to use.

Also, Leadpages has a preview feature that offers users an accurate idea of how their page will look whenever it goes live. This comes with previews on all landing pages' pop-ups

Complementing this, users can also checkout how their own website will be viewed by users who use a smartphone or tablet on smaller devices.

### Landing Page Templates

If you want to build your landing page, but your mind has blanked,Â LeadpagesÂ has you covered.

To help you craft the sales page you want as quickly as possible Leadpages offers users over 150 templates to choose from, which you can check out here.

Now, these templates don't only look beautiful, but they've been fully optimized through many split tests for the best results possible.

What makes it so smart is that Leadpages can optimize these landing pages based on the data that the users have provided them. You're even able to sort the landing pages templates by the conversion rate to find the perfect template for you.

The available templates vary for a range of purposes. So regardless of whether you're selling a physical product, info product, or looking to get new leads, Leadpages will have the best landing page template or set up for you.

And when you pair this awesome feature with the drag and drop content builder you've got a match made in heaven for building beautiful landing pages with ease!

### Quickstart Tool

Now the two features that we mentioned above will sound if you have read our other landing page builder reviews. However, this next feature is unique to Leadpages, and there's no doubt it's part of the reason Leadpages has grown to the stature it stands at today.

Having access to such a wide range of templates and such free choice over the design layout can be intimidating and overwhelming for some new entrepreneurs.

So, to help you get started with Leadpages you can choose to be asked a few questions immediately after signing up.

These questions aim to decide what template is best for you based on your needs. You know your options are continually narrow down until the template matches your goals.

If you're starting as an entrepreneur, then you won't have all the time in the world. With so many templates to choose from, having your options easily narrowed down based on your personal goals is useful. You can speed up the decision-making process and get your landing page ready ASAP.

And even if there are elements you don't like, you can just add them using the drag and drop builder.Â 

### Integrations

What can make or break a landing page builder is the number of integrations that it can hold.

And with its competitors in the industry offering such a wide range of available integrations, the pressure is certainly on for Leadpages to deliver in this aspect and boy have they delivered!

Leadpages offers one of the best integration systems in the landing pages building industry.

On this list alone we counted over 90 different integration platforms ranging from payments, social media marketing, live chats, and webinar tools.

Youâ€™d have to search long and hard to find a platform that doesnâ€™t integrate with Leadpages

Oh, and if you do find one then it's highly likely you'll find it onÂ [Zapier](https://devinschumacher.com/review/zapier), which integrates with Leadpages. This opens almost 1000 other apps which you just can benefit from Leadpages.

Getting set up is easy, all you must do is create a Zapier account and download the extension to begin integrating it with your landing page.

### Analytics

Leadpages include a set of stats and analytics for all of your landing pages.

This allows you to evaluate how your split tests are performing and gain more information about how each aspect of your sales funnel is converting.

It's perfect for creating optimal page designs and is a marketerâ€™s paradise if you enjoy spending time optimizing aspects of your funnel.

These analytics are easy to access and are available on every single page that you create on the platform.

Just when you thought the landing page software couldn't get any better: you can even integrate it with Google Analytics to get even more data.

This is useful to see which ideas and aspects of your funnel are worth pursuing feature and which are not worth investing in. This kind of information is only available if you choose a platform with analytics like this.

### Support

When it comes to customer support, Leadpages has a reputation for being amongst the best in the whole industry.

You can check out the extensive Leadpages Knowledge Base to find help with any kind of issue that you face.

And even if you can't find what you're looking for amongst the hundreds of pages that are available, youâ€™re always free to contact the support team via email.

The team is said to be responsive, kind, and helpful in helping their users solve their issues.

I've never had to use Leadpages to support myself. Maybe this is because their platform is so intuitive and straightforward.

But still, it offers users a great sense of peace of mind to know that a qualified support team is always by your side to help if things go wrong.

## Pros of Leadpages

Truthfully, we could talk all day about how great Leadpages is, and how easy it is to use and the awesome Leadpages support team. But most of the main benefits are outlined above.

## Cons of Leadpages

The main drawback that people often remark about Leadpages is the drag and drop builder.

Users will often complain that the builder is quite sluggish and doesn't offer as much freedom as its competitors, such asÂ [Clickfunnels](https://devinschumacher.com/review/clickfunnels/)Â orÂ [Unbounce](https://devinschumacher.com/review/unbounce).

Apart from that, some of the other common complaints include following

- Less customization

- Limited A/B split testing

- No enterprise option for larger businesses

Generally, however, we think that you can tell by the length of this section of the article how strong Leadpages is.

Sure, no landing page builder is perfect but this one is not that far off it.

There are some amazing features in this platform, and in our eyes that makes it enough to be considered one of the very best in the whole industry.

## Leadpages Cost

Leadpages has three pricing plans. Based on the paid monthly plans, they are:

- **Standard**Â â€“ $37 per month

With every plan, you have the option to take out an annual plan at a discounted rate or pay monthly.

And according to Leadpages, they offer a 30-day money-back guarantee on top of this. If you don't like the platform you can cancel at any time by visiting their website.

If you're a new business owner and want to avoid large monthly expensive then the standard plan should be enough for you.

However, if you want to accept payments directly from your landing page then the pro option might be for you. Keep in mind that you're also going to need this plan for SMS text campaigns.

The advanced plan is more suited for larger businesses. If you think this might be the right plan for you, you can even schedule a one-on-one call with a Leadpages representative to talk it through.

Here you can ask them any kind of questions you have but their platform and how it can be used directly for your business.

But if you read all this and you're still not sure whether Leadpages is right for you then you can try it out on a 14-day free trial.
