## GPUs Function Well for AI Workloads

The Graphical Processing Unit's simple objective is to efficiently manipulate computer visuals and image processing, as its name implies. 

Since they have multiple cores and tremendous throughput, GPUs conduct parallel computing tasks and can handle thousands of operations simultaneously much more effectively than CPUs. 

These skills are applicable to a wide range of use cases, including AI but especially gaming and high-performance computing.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QA4mo18ARdgbkpaRUYwmKxF_IZSHtPN4DpYGFCtXA8QYVJFMFmyYp_j1Ahd8cQ8FPzdd70fFS0pHvxMgMwwHKeb3hzjVjD0JFgUATBSbKbgEVtgxR8Z_D5jrer21mIrfGsAR-ZMOaUFi7R0mUPUpYSM)

In summary, GPUs have significantly surpassed the needs of data scientists due to their capacity to execute several computations at once. 

For example, training a Deep Learning model using massive data sets may be accomplished with a GPU in a matter of hours as opposed to weeks with a CPU.

## Instances Powered by GPU: T2 Instances

GPU instances are the first way to use GPU in the Public Cloud. You receive a virtual machine with dedicated CPU resources (vCore and RAM) that you can provide as needed and manage via APIs. 

But most importantly, you receive GPU resources via PCI Passthrough, ranging from one to four Nvidia Tesla cards.

Your AI application workloads can directly contact the GPU, utilize all of the available computational power, and enjoy excellent performance because there is no virtualization layer present.

You may now set up our T2 instances (for Tesla 2nd generation) for running GPU instances through APIs or your control panel. According to the table below, those T2 instances have more CPU cores than T1 and are built with Nvidia Tesla v100s GPU cards, which have 32GB of RAM per card (compared to 16GB for T1) and 32GB of RAM per card, respectively.

**Of course, T2 examples adhere to our SMART strategy:**

- Simple to comprehend pricing

- Multi-local - Accessible in the data centers in Gravelines, Beauharnois, and Limburg

- Accessibility - Check the cost of p3.2xlarge to come up with your own concept.

- Reversible - Simply retrieve your data and end your instance

- Transparent - There is no entry or exit, making it incredibly predictable

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- There is a wide range of instance kinds available, from the most basic to the most advanced

- Several datacenter sites

- Management UI is now contemporary, and comparatively quick, although it's still a little complicated in 2020

### Cons

- There is a long delay between placing an order and creating an instance for "Virtual Private Servers"

## Pricing

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wfyCWxPhpKTE_oGxNI54zU81D5H6vuJuPrL0QIYWErQI0Y4uTtX4Tx0Q-ZSDqVfgavdCFk6F1HGOYnTa2xKZBrDdnf527GBqLd566AyUcRZpLlhRNAh65NYn8vwepbCONxU4GFXvk2WxQKSvZt5k0bg)

VPS, dedicated servers, managed bare metal hosting, as well as additional storage, backup, network, security, email, big data solutions, domain name registration, and management services, are all included in the range of cloud hosting solutions offered by OVHcloud.com.

The "Personal" cloud service costs $3.99 per month with an annual membership, making it one of the more affordable cloud alternatives. 

This package can give you five websites, a free domain name for the first year, 100GB of SSD storage, unlimited bandwidth, ten email accounts with a maximum size of 1GB, one SQL database with a maximum size of 200 MB, support for Python (CGI), MySQL 5.6, PHP (8.0/7.3/8.0), WordPress optimization, anti-DDoS defense, and a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate (opens in new tab). 

You'll need to buy a larger plan if you want more features and fewer resource limitations.

Since OVHcloud doesn't offer free trials or money-back guarantees with its services, you'll lose all of the money you've already paid, including additional setup fees, if you decide to quit their services.

Regarding payment options, [OVHcloud](https://serp.ly/OVHcloud/) accepts Visa, MasterCard, and Maestro credit/debit cards, PayPal, checks, postal orders, and bank transfers.

## Easy to Use

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_0YyTXdHEJweXs3Vh5Logi32E0Kuo0L_L089Q4gZMsMVCrcyOxxFis81OzaMGyZALCAyJ7AubwddYTBVDoKCAaBUuC61_qQzc9fOnxEUflAdviWTYwvX7pIcXHI4k9W5q9rBnU9p4JGHZ4VASc-ukzk)

You'll be prompted to choose a pre-installed CMS from WordPress, PrestaShop, Drupal, or Joomla after choosing the plan you want to use, or you can choose not to use one. A CDN and additional SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt SSL is free) are available as add-ons. 

Following that, you may select your domain name. A domain name is offered with every OVHcloud plan for free for the first year.

You must log in right away if you have an OVHcloud account. Creating one will require your full name, email address, and password if you don't already have one. It's also a good idea to read the "Terms of Service" before moving on. 

After that, you must accept an email verification and provide all the necessary information (your phone number, nation, city, zip code, and language) to complete the account creation process.

When everything is finished, you'll have access to the OVHcloud dashboard, where you may finish making your purchase if you haven't already. 

You should be able to keep an eye on and manage every aspect of your account from here, including password changes, backup creation and restoration, database creation and deletion, and other operations.

Unfortunately, you can only select from cPanel, Plesk, DirectAdmin, and ISPconfig3 with some plans, even if you are ready to spend some money on an easy-to-use industry-standard control panel. 

For example, cPanel offers dedicated server hosting plans, which start at $56.75 per month. But most consumers looking for straightforward solutions won't be prepared to pay this steep price.

## Swiftness and Expertise

It is common knowledge that a large number of data centers dispersed throughout the world will guarantee lightning-fast performance, and [OVHcloud](https://serp.ly/ovhcloud) is no exception.

The main OVHcloud website takes 2.9 seconds to fully load according to a GTmetrix test, although the required speed is less than 3.5 seconds (and the average one is 8.1). 

Additionally, all other online vitals (speed measuring parameters) displayed respectable performance, culminating in a total GTmetrix score of nearly perfect A (95%)

In terms of uptime, OVHcloud provides a 99.9% uptime guarantee supported by SLA across all VPS price categories.

They also assert that all of their data centers are built in accordance with Tier 3+ standards, which stipulate that a site should experience a total annual downtime of no more than 1.6 hours (or 99.982% uptime). 

We tracked just one instance of downtime during a two-week uptime test on the main OVHcloud website (using UptimeRobot), although it lasted for a continuous 15 minutes. This came to 99.93% uptime, which is a little less than we anticipated but still within the uptime guarantee.

## Support

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LlylNPwC6Qr2-JXg4o3VySzOlBBB7irinJMwF6bizmk6-T6Yp1g9mgt6xWmdBsYVy7xfBSq26wmHaiLWVED-Z7nooXI-QXyL9ptMLXBLQe0J-GrkYEq7ahjuWR-frCz5BsTC3SOWlohEK7IFIgaveV8)

OVHcloud asserts that it is totally committed to its clients, yet this doesn't seem to be the case when it comes to customer service. 

There are four levels of support, with "Standard Support" being the lowest level. It comprises a number of self-help resources like a knowledge base, a community forum, and a short FAQ section.

It's wonderful that the knowledge base has so many step-by-step instructions (some of them include videos and others screenshots). There isn't much to assist and motivate newbies. 

On the other hand, despite the fact that there are numerous queries from previous months that remain unaddressed, the community forum appears to be rather busy.

It's important to remember that "Standard Service" is the sole type of support that is included with every hosting solution at no extra cost. "Premium Support" is available for $56 per month, "Business Support" begins at $300 per month, and to learn how much "Enterprise Support" will cost you, you must ask for a callback from the sales staff.

You can reach the [OVHcloud](https://serp.ly/ovhcloud) sales team by phone (weekdays from 9 AM to 5 PM) and email/ticket, but don't anticipate getting much more than the most basic information from them.

## Conclusion

​​With more than 20 years of experience, OVHcloud appears committed to offering its clients a range of affordably priced cloud-based necessities, such as VPS, dedicated servers, bare-metal servers, hosted private clouds, public clouds, as well as hybrid solutions

.

We recommend using OVHcloud for your GPU needs!
