Security should be on the top of your priority list when choosing a web hosting provider. Whether you manage a personal blog site, a small business, or a huge enterprise, securing your and your client's data is a must.

As a business owner, you need to put the minds of your customers at ease by ensuring them that the data they share with your site is safe and secure.

The promise of safe and secure hosting will always be something that any web hosting company will use in marketing their hosting services.

Knowing the high level of importance of security to their customer's website, some other hosting providers do not offer this for free; instead, they offer separate plans for security on top of the hosting plans.

Thankfully, SiteGround thinks differently. Almost all of its essential security features are for free. Yes, you read it right! You only have to pay for the SG site scanner, which you can opt not to add to your plan.

Here are some of SiteGround's security features:

### Smart Web Applications Firewalls

It prevents software exploits to protect servers and your site from threats. It protects applications like WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal.

### AI Anti-bot

### 24/7 Monitoring
