All your website files are located in cPanel's file manager, and you can upload, edit, and delete your website files. However, if you want to perform actions much quicker, then using an FTP Program to manage your files is recommended.

#### Backup

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/pOThKROSCP6wA3dJn8LOuWlI9BuEvFz91zROw7SptKzkwfAElwAJlPsKT01DQQxzxrhQwlGXp09V-UorbkCKxeym3Z6qiF--WcIO7dhkKwijB6z-PTTXgyMLSfKlm-BzGlB0Wle6gzbd9zf5oCuxqDw)

To download and save your files, cPanel provides a backup interface where you can keep records of your files, databases, forwarders, and filters in one backup file. However, if you're a beginner, consider using the Backup Wizard.

#### Disk Usage

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/CQ8iWX5fl0vq2x1zt8kdfBmVcvZu35Uo6942kElyPiLxX1TDo9InzPohLubbUXDv0zGV5G4feP6z5talD5b90ksw0ElXmWCtrvMxw3yMQRYMsG8-Lb2MwBveBRuDuWGyiE7Z1jG-HpdjZuZhuQV3NZY)

The Disk Usage shows the overall disk space used on your account. This includes all data, including website files, databases, and emails. The summary can be found on the lower right part of your cPanel dashboard.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/PW7QSpjAbNAbdk6u4qyWObUMj_ssSJgFhAGJRQyI9HKT-tsl3SJtq7vsjQrtXt3QkqWOaJvR2v8JUgOJPnDcVRaWwmzqN3JyRZR-lzTnAoNJ__9Cb8Sc7dLiFi2g_4-Pq5G_ueEvXIQ0I_KkynWVPD0)

#### FTP Accounts

The majority of web developers use FTP to upload files, pages, and images to the internet. There are numerous FTP programs available, some free, some expensive, and some simply better than others. When you register a hosting package with HostGator, an FTP account is generated by default.

### Domains

You can create, set up, and build subdomains, as well as set up redirects and do much more in the Domains section of cPanel. 

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IpjNKfbEDH8EXRT3qW9v_zIJ7ckeHSUWVNua_VaVufcVAtj12xrxbnyzjYa9__L5fa_tKUbeNr7j9KayGmtQpCd6JKHK3lr-4VgqBU7210i7-E4dI8Qbqmp252lEYG1xpWC8JwxbTELRTFg1e_WoltI)

HostGator makes it simple to manage your domain. HostGator registers domain names through two registrars, LaunchPad and eNom, but you can control both using HostGator's Domain Control Panel.

### Databases

Databases provide an easy way to manage enormous amounts of information through the web. Numerous web-based applications, such as bulletin boards, content management systems, and online retail shops, require them to function.

#### MySQL Databases

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8bpwt6VBGRpQZsjoeiFWJLkyOIp4UyaWY-j9u94Id9MiH_I___UGZDeeFPurR8anzC9Scz1mwrExvpsMKxzndjR0mpTQGE1omX9RGHzZ7Rra1EeJ8WcP9ekzixQ-vz_WVH7Gmr-TcAF87ZeltxVoHDw)

On the Databases section of cPanel, you can manage user database permissions and create, delete, and modify users and MySQL databases. Furthermore, User Privileges are essential since they define how a user interacts with the database.

To do website management operations such as performing queries or changing databases, specific users must have access.

#### phpMyAdmin

phpMyAdmin is a PHP-based program for managing MySQL databases over the internet. Databases should be established in cPanel or Plesk, yet phpMyAdmin allows you to delete databases, create, drop, alter tables; delete, edit, add fields, run any SQL statement, manage keys on fields, and export or import data into multiple formats. 

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/tXixQMho5dBof9nQHNgAfz5zTm0jbQiEf0MJGhFI0WylcjjiHM1CETXn4DlOuClMeQQIjxS2zIByjWTDC7W0Z8FuEDk_x2IlzKZLIx3ESmBMoEURd3qyEfbcuCWwt-EMTbS_djUHmhpEXHeUUfYi2HQ)

Simply tap on the database name in the left margin of the webpage to explore the structure of your databases. The structure of the database can be viewed by clicking on the name of the database.

To assist you in managing your hosting account, cPanel provides a variety of monitoring and statistics tools. Visitors, Errors, Bandwidth, Raw Access, CPU and Concurrent Connection Usage, Webalizer, and Webalizer FTP are among the tools available. 

You can see them all in the Metrics section of cPanel. Metrics enable you to determine where your traffic comes from, the number of your site visitors, and what sections of your website are being viewed the most.

### WordPress Themes

WordPress is a fantastic CMS for creating a website, whether for leisure or business. Because of its prominence, countless themes have been made that are either free, include a paid upgrade, or are premium themes.

Themes can be obtained directly from the WordPress.org collection of themes, which is accessible through your dashboard, or from third-party sources.

Themes are one of the most valuable elements that WordPress has to offer. These pre-designed and pre-coded themes are simple to upload and activate on your website. 

WordPress and its development community have generated thousands of unique WordPress themes, each with its own set of traits, designs, and structures.

## Hostgator Customer Support

HostGator offers 24/7/365 customer support, and you have three options to contact support: via live chat through phone, and you can reach them by sending an email as well.

A web hosting review wouldn't be complete without testing the customer support. 

Let's proceed, shall we? To gain access to the support team, you can head to their website, and on the upper right corner of the homepage, you will see a phone number - which you can call and a Live Chat Support button which will redirect you to this page: 

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/hkKviLU_tAtgG4Q1DHJnHIdAbJTkLhZe7MktD3d2EUAh4SMa3pe-DhHjuBHaDqCCG6XCVq0zKVxRsRPndRbojtAw34SlA3V1BwtnlepEJ0VAOSSVLBKWI5aXJHS-xxjI0IsnzodjlfO1395EddjqkWU)

Here you need to input all the necessary information to be able to proceed with the actual live chat. After stating your concerns, click Proceed to Chat. 

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NyFYTcZAYYkVhqmmKClOat2IFNoapfYZZ8omik-IHcHwffKa1atrSETcFIbHV9HTahzSsq-rVb6M5HsHDRdixcKXOIDq6ZThRvvo0YK-9RT8PA7FzLtx0U4-qkJN9FyGCAUZvY-RnIsf0fNERZT_GhI)

You can see on the lower part of the image that no person is available to answer my queries and that I also have to wait 5 minutes to be connected with an agent. As someone who needs an instant response, this is not a good experience, but it's not bad either. If you have spare time to spend, it should be fine to wait for this long. 

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/s_sH1sh5wDV5pDDewenki4Dk0Asd-Wf4o0bs2I9P0Ap-sOeB-OF3SW_7lpfJKLQTpniRpGXJobs0HcEUeKGYBb10ej0BdfxM2y4E-yTbYpUVK49qFX-zmrtyMOj9sCii58TKtDLTHPmma_8JLO80dfs)

After waiting for a few minutes, I was connected with an agent who answered my query directly. You see, this is always what I'm looking for because, as a customer or a future subscriber, you don't want customer support to offer you a range of upsells before answering your question. 

Moreover, they also have a Knowledgebase where you can simply search for your concerns, and from there, you will be provided with information and tutorials to solve them. You can access this by locating the support tab on the upper homepage. When you encounter an issue, you will initially look for ways to resolve it. 

With the web hosting provider's Knowledgebase, you can ensure that the instructions on how to address such matters are accurate. This is what it looks like: 

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/PE5Yh_5iLFt8Up-Dh7nHW-xkNvw9Qz3Kkq9i_wTsPpaEtQRpXv8277xGXNozMuJeahy1euWuWvquVBIlzI4MdwaOnAspOmKkrk1TS5x_fryRjrGmEXDIHUzZN1_OP93qmvMXPBraYFKBjlQlAJT4Gjs)

HostGator provides different areas of concern for you to quickly find which one you're looking for. Overall, they have lived up to the quality customer service. Although their live chat support is not as instant, so take note of that.

## Buyer’s Guide For Hostgator

## HostGator Pricing and Plans

- Unlimited MySQL databases

- Round-the-clock server monitoring

- Unlimited FTP users

- One-click installs

- 24/7/365 customer support

Below are the web hosting plans HostGator offers: Shared Hosting plans starts at $2.75/month. 

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/gRp2d5h3XcIQvPz_Og5EkVy3ulpkonyTZ5suM2FZTaPWapTgt2B1zoMnovSYaVG1e2FxLKLEI0FU9oam79N5WtCwxD7-qxF-xIiy49qsRzasi5l-HsPCtZvVe33VK5RaKlX8iP5WF5MhbeUkPaCUQ-Y)

Shared hosting is a form of web hosting in which numerous websites share a single server. Because websites share resources in this configuration, a massive traffic surge across one site can, sadly, have a negative impact on the performance of another site. 

On another note, the Business plan offers more features than the others. When you purchased the top-tier plan, you will have a private SSL, a dedicated IP, unlimited websites, and unlimited bandwidth. 

If you're searching for affordable hosting, shared hosting is a decent choice; unless you want more excellent server resources committed to your website, you'll need to go with VPS hosting or dedicated hosting. 

HostGator provides shared hosting solutions based on Linux or Windows that allow small and medium-sized organizations to expand. Website Builder plans starts at $3.84/month. 

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8o8khQhjFrOSIWPaB4t2LoGyJkKYXTTdiEUuhsUHR0qK_MznKrfEe1b1HBXVoVKYS6RClVjCvlljefoBnBAAj2uX-dq7HhL7atEk_7SC9XOG7Pd1_6Nq1IJY7CwPByQPei1_8GOin6EmEdkVHJ-8zCY)

Gator is a simple web builder designed for people with no technical knowledge who require a basic website. It combines an easy-to-use drag-and-drop editor with a selection of templates that are ready for you to customize. 

Gator has numerous capabilities, some of which are a little basic, making it ideal for any small business that has to advertise a service or personal sites such as blogs. WordPress Hosting plans starts at $5.95/month. 

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/t6xjEAlpFI2YSnp7JTXoic0bnMNFHOpjNmhB6dJhf8sIiGkimaU7fUaxolak5mgScwPbSUIucVg35VMbURgwaQuavcWkaayGs1MFbTuBqUU8uLtPWRN8ZJmad2cOb1AG56HA515mq1UcPkoA2vAZSaU)

HostGator allows you to install WordPress with any of its servers; however, the web host additionally offers three categories of managed WordPress hosting: Starter, Standard, and Business. 

All plans include page caching and a WordPress hosting environment that is optimized. Even if you don't go the managed WordPress way, WordPress is simple to set up on HostGator. Quick Link is a feature in the customer portal that offers a separate interface for downloading third-party programs. 

Also, there is a link to the Quick Links interface called Get Started With WordPress Today. HostGator also installed the WP-Super-Cache WordPress plug-in automatically to help boost blog performance. VPS Hosting plans starts at $19.95/month. 

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/yOYmYIyCdPv25WyBirwmP8uikxvD9ArTEqQ4Dgl8xq78kfQ_Iv-7iO_L5atNpHGNKIUFC5QxIn02PS1cDd3EO4yC52vWN3CgFMJa44b8vpJy_uV70Pkc88p__eme3-gqOCe9w8Tt-FPsDSH2nTWDnRc)

Virtual private server (VPS) web hosting is intended for users who require more server power than shared hosting provides. VPS hosting allows numerous sites to coexist on a server, though significantly less than on a shared hosting server. You will pay more for a VPS server, but you will receive more server power in exchange. 

If you require greater power, anticipate significant traffic levels, or have specific compliance requirements that restrict you from using shared servers but do not want to pay dedicated server pricing, these are reasonable alternatives to consider. Dedicated Hosting plans starts at $89.98/month. 

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/8_6Vu6uDOlO59a8DAaeTmZgZfl6LuaWmeSWGrvfRhl_eIQ6xQxj_W8sPkRwlcLaYUh1FjwPUw1tZBMXO3kwJTh_1MyU3NmsUZGztSdSJXzwglQsbP0H70Ap0AT45Ut7v17_SWwzBzg-AwfUZI3rzbZE)

Dedicated server hosting is a strong type of web hosting in which your site exists on its server. As a result, while this is the most costly web hosting, it is also the most powerful. Therefore, if you anticipate a lot of traffic, this is what you should use to power your site. 

HostGator's dedicated servers are available in both Linux and Windows variants, which isn't as popular as you might assume; Linux typically dominates the market. In fact, HostGator is one of the few web hosting providers that received high marks that provides both operating systems. Reseller Hosting plans starts at $19.95/month. 

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/9YaGQ7g2JdXmoSNOzIe_eRUIwR_6XKQh76qEoTqqLQXejfHaZePrh6_Earisw1VtSTawYJwyEiqQRx9sKJNYRgMdi31Z3ln4gF7Wx1auuYfG0_8sXEqUdP-L-yq-FToG2ByEBmbg0WhpcJlhLxPwlNU)

Check out [HostGator's](https://serp.ly/hostgator) reseller hosting packages if you want to get into the web hosting business but don't want to deal with structural problems. The plans begin at $19.95 per month and include unlimited email across the spectrum. 

The shared, dedicated, and VPS packages are available in both Linux and Windows variants; however, HostGator does not provide unlimited storage and monthly data transfers at each tier. On the bright side, HostGator allows you to personalize the servers you lease and offers 24/7 technical assistance. Cloud Hosting plans starts at $4.95/month. 

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lz9h5nWcz0EOc-9Ej2saVg2N2IUQvxQeIlswpzu1eGAlH0V3UYATMW1jGytdJQXe5M29oZu2BTiLVSn9Pgv5iCevMAh5T83b4AFPo0iF55Uhcneakoy_4b4wbDaJFpj_517fcyn6QuNmNb-_hCWsK14)

HostGator offers three different cloud hosting options. For caching, the cloud employs high-end hardware, low-density servers, and several caching layers. As a result, your page loading times will be faster. As your traffic grows, HostGator Cloud hosting allows you to scale up your resources with a single click. 

All of this occurs without the need for any downtime, reboots, or data migrations. Regardless of the plan, you will have access to HostGator's user-friendly interface. From here, you'll be able to track all of the indicators connected to the performance of your website.

## Server Speed and Uptime

Based on WP Beginner's HostGator speed test, their site loaded in 1.03 seconds - that's fast! But, because it is a new website with zero traffic, a speed test is not the greatest way to assess its performance. They wanted to see how it would perform during peak hours. So they used another tool to test its performance in high traffic. 

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/utB7iqpHCijLbVsqjjD8sy7UgWTmCV57_pMfbAuq5Ktyenwf-zKBWZXKSsGZYIvIW-bWqVql5IayH7CI-HoCMQSc0LjDAht9fldgzVi__hN-511ptLckg2yasT10g-YRPXzuTmSN2KES-cKVYOtHAMk)

The test site performed really well throughout the test with an average response time of 203 ms, and I would say this result is pretty great for a shared hosting account! Moving on to the uptime of HostGator, WP Beginner's test site did not disappoint! It performed admirably and did not go down during the tests.

## Security and Backups

HostGator takes many precautions to guarantee that servers continue to operate at maximum capacity. The data centers in Houston and Provo are designed to avoid service outages, and to that end, they contain cutting-edge server technology, network, electrical, and HVAC systems. 

They have high-tech cooling systems to keep servers from overheating, backup power sources in the event of a blackout, lasers to locate fires, and multiple chillers, among several other technologies. In addition, HostGator uses Cloudflare - a global network of 152 datacenters. 

Cloudflare recently added 22 data centers in mainland China. HostGator provides a few additional security options, such as the option to add SiteLock monitoring to your website. This service will run every day, scanning for potential site breaches or hacks and notifying you immediately if they uncover one. 

They have included Spam Assassin in their email services to prevent spam from ever reaching your inbox. The only drawback is that SiteLock will cost you a little more money; the starting price is $1.99 per month, payable annually at $23.88. When it comes to backups, HostGator is not really the finest in the market. 

This provider only performs weekly backups and demands payment if you would like your website retrieved from a backup. But even though the chances of HostGator servers failing are extremely low because of the many security measures in place, if you intend to input a considerable amount of data to your webpage frequently, you might have to do your own backup or go with a hosting provider that backs up their servers every day or perhaps even hourly – which, as always, corresponds to added expenses.
