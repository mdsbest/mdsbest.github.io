> I bought a lifetime license of Minitool Partition Magic a few years ago so I wouldn't have to renew my subscription. It was intended to let me install it on up to five different devices. However, over time, all five of my computers' hard drives were replaced, leaving me with a lifetime subscription that I couldn't reinstall on them. I emailed assistance at minitool.com to explain the matter and was pleasantly delighted when they emailed me a new license at no cost. That is what I mean by customer-focused support. I will undoubtedly recommend MiniTool to all of my colleagues.

> Minitool provides a varied and robust array of software tools ranging from disk management and backup solutions to video editing, all of which are functional, intuitive to use, and very simple to learn in my experience. Customer service and technical support are good, with rapid responses to requests for assistance and straightforward advice in non-technical words. Purchase is not subscription-based, with lifetime licenses and upgrades available at reasonable pricing. Examine them out.

> I was looking for software to delete all of the data on my laptop that I intended to give away. I discovered that the Mini Wizard Partition Tool provided free software to accomplish just that. It received good marks, and the instructions were simple to follow. Their website provided assistance for the free version. I only had one question, so I sent an email. To my amazement, I received a response within 2 hours! I wasn't expecting a response for days, let alone two hours! Nancy was really helpful, and I was able to wipe my laptop clean and give it away with confidence. I would use it again without hesitation. I definitely recommend utilizing this program and the individuals that created it!!!!

> During the process of cloning my system drive, I ran across an issue. During this process, the recovery partition was not copied over to the new location. It was possible for me to separately duplicate the partition by resizing the partitions on the drive, which was a little tricky. There was, however, a simpler approach, and Minitool helped make it so that I could do it easily; as a result, I now have no trouble cloning my system drive and backing it up. Once a week, I make a backup of it. The answer was as straightforward as it gets, and Minitool provided it without any reservations. It is reassuring to learn that the Minitool help line provides answers that are both quick and easy to implement.
