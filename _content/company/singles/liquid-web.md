The numbers don't lie and this can be seen throughout user reviews; they received numerous 5 out of 5 stars from their loyal and trusted customers.

## Getting Started with Liquid Web

Opening the Liquid Web site for the first time can be quite intimidating; it was in my case at least. Thanks to the wide range of products and features that they offer, my immediate thought was that they are a very serious and expansive company. 

The Liquid Web site screams sophistication, elegance, and premiere service. It was quite a challenge to find the exact Liquid Web hosting plan that fits my purpose of getting a good quality review of their services. 

For this review, I signed up for a managed WordPress hosting plan for my test site. I choose the Spark plan at $19.50/month, although I got it on sale for $9.50. This plan comes with 1 managed site, 15 GB of storage, and 2 TB of bandwidth. 

After I clicked the Get Started button, I was redirected to the Nexcess Portal.

![Screenshot of purchase process for the WordPress Spark plan](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/s4FyBRGSB8BcNJdAeElkbhZxEz9VTTkVxmLLMwLX1hXctwZrRu63xydYzNbfeoCP4WtpclrAM3Ids6VDUZ43BtD7Bk7Uw4aiRCkvNVKGeRuDl3xNom7Msu4Q3jDRO4Yt8_EXoijx-4249Ecdz3gsj7U)

On this page, you choose the plan terms and input account information. You'll also find your purchase details here. After inputting my details I clicked the Sign-Up button, added my billing address and payment option. 

With this, the purchase for this web hosting provider plan was finalized.

## How to Manage Your Website Using Liquid Web

### [Nexcess](https://serp.ly/nexcess)

Nexcess is the cloud web hosting service optimized for digital commerce. They've partnered with Liquid Web to give managed WordPress and managed WooCommerce plans. After logging in to my account, I was directed to this homepage.

![Screenshot of the Nexcess dashboard](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/AS4mMWZynOHa1X4nZLDFLXGPB7_kX7OYwyICRCYg6lTWtj0cbwv0r7gf20SX1upc5VLmfdqwtz3w1TTsyMtcusnnnAhiDQxIRER3xJK5a1HJqVSL6gJpcLVQk30ZaAK9RbpYIY4wIV7x7LSt68hXkg4)

Your account ID, password, active tickets, invoices, and cred can be found in this client area. You'll also see the section for system status, servers, and data center. 

here is a search field, the latest blog post from the Liquid Web support team, and an announcement for scheduled maintenance. 

You can see tabs for Home, Plans, SSL, Support, Billings, and DNS on the right. Once I clicked the Plan tab, I was redirected to this page.

![Screenshot of the Nexcess Plans screen](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/erbIyIMSN_OO2fsVxVZKFWO7sw4YpCYOIZVhL7AedeGfcTB36KnEJFxoFyiYBxBTKNC7paks5S0WhoSJToTVJEN79F0OKUc-xEj23-5xEyqxIpRPF6ajBVhrYY_zFqnBx4OzbxYXyqy1Rmyf-3UXtJE)

In the SSL tab, you'll find the SSL certificates you ordered for your site. An SSL certificate is like a badge of honor you can put on your site to show users that the site is safe, secure, and reliable. It is a crucial component of websites that require the exchange of sensitive information such as personal info and card details. 

The SSL certificate comes in different forms depending on the website's level of security. I did not have any yet, so I clicked the Order Certificate button on the left. 

On the order page, you get to select the type of certificate (single domain, multi-domain, or wildcard), then input the source of the certificate and your details. 

Then you will proceed to the payment screen for your purchase.

![Screenshot of the SSL Certificate ordering process](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/dF6sVcjUbnNw6nGvmhz-9SS6FvuyenzFo4Frjq7_Z_eMD38vzsIAfh4keVOYYmdKlbTTpS27rvKJnESCEalAqYoUts8WIcBp0oUbHgaEExfNSKCgJX61Ggo6x9KfZw8ccdyoWwsSkfU2eXluVPvsYzg)

The Support Tab shows your support tickets. Tickets are used if you want to ask for help from the Liquid Web support team. 

You can write down your concern, choose the department you are trying to address, and so on. Once you are done with writing down everything, click Add to finalize the ticket. 

There is also a button to Request Migration at the right side of the page. 

Liquid Web offers free site migration from other web hosts. You need to have a paid plan from Liquid Web before you can avail any free site migrations.

![Screenshot of the Ticket (support) system](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/y3RVjKiDDR4yrJzOjlJT_uqbQMTap9S0W0PbmOiLb5whMla8yEmvG30YAcOaRjpL_Jvu3XKu3hZLdYkOhjolDm4gzLnqYZk_WMYl2i1PT-MgVeDRCNqVQAJrG_mwQCt-LcRJaVf5GVdZCNERAWB-Zvo)

The Billings tab shows your invoices, credits, payments, payment info, and orders. Here, you can see the summary and details of purchased plans, certificates, add-ons, and more. The Domains tab shows your DNS zone. 

You can add your domain here. 

You can also click the three dots to view your domain details or to delete them from your zone. 

If you click the User Menu to the right, you'll see a dropdown list containing the following:

![Screenshot of the User Menu options](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/pRhFzUKNC7anbwcQtn8odLvb0SVZTcxWid760eCQ8jkhY1ZzMx1in_jPwP5XWCjSN8gXBHKoPtAB5MWQIZecf7r7mX2Yo_Yd_LTaLZhsBuHs9GMtPaQrTB7gwQ4DOzdF3q2wdK2UbiSUrQZB9p_tw9c)

- Feedback - allows you to suggest an idea to the Liquid Web support staff.

When you sign up for a Liquid Web Managed Hosting plan, make sure to explore the Client Area and familiarize yourself with its functions. As I have observed, it is very user and beginner-friendly.

## Liquid Web Hosting Management Panels

[Liquid Web](https://serp.ly/liquid-web-gpu-hosting) uses 3 different control panels for website hosting account management. The availability of them depends on the web hosting plans purchased by the customers. Most plans will give you the option to choose any of the three. 

Some need to be additionally purchased, while others are included in the plans. In my case, I have more experience with cPanel and that's what I recommend to beginners as well. 

Choosing a control panel can be intimidating, but you should always go with what makes you more comfortable. 

A lot of resources are available at your fingertips; you can watch videos, read the manuals from Liquid Web's pool of resources, and compare reviews. The most effective method perhaps is talking to someone who is an expert. 

Use a ticket and submit your concern to Liquid Web's 'Most Helpful Humans' to help with your concern. One thing in common that control panel dashboards have is how they arrange the tools based on their functions. 

But if I had to choose a winner in that category, I would choose cPanel. The way it is arranged is straightforward to understand and easy to use; tools are grouped nicely without overlapping. 

All of the Liquid Web management panels show the server overview on their homepage. I like that it is one of the first things you see when you log in. From there, you can decide which part of your account needs some work. 

All of these include the general features necessary for a control panel.

- Domain management – configure and manage them.

- File management – manage and upload files, make backups and restore them.

- Email management – manage and set up emails, access webmail, configure spam filters, mailing lists, and forwarders.

- Database management – set up and manage your databases

- Stats – find out various metrics about your site

- Security – SSL certificates, SSH access, IP blockers, etc.

- Software installers – easy installations of popular web scripts such as WordPress, Joomla, and others.

## Getting Started with InterWorx

You can log into InterWorx by using your Liquid Web account. After logging in, you'll see the various navigation links on the left; clicking one will show additional menu items predominantly related to website management.

Keep in mind that InterWorx is mainly oriented towards advanced users. The SiteWorx tab shows all your web and domain accounts. 

You can also modify the SiteWorx accounts from here. These modifications include modifying account settings, changing passwords and IP addresses, and account deletion.

The NodeWorx tab is basically a system admin for managing servers and hosting accounts.

Here, you can see the status of your system services, CPU, memory, bandwidth usage, and general server information.

## Getting Started with cPanel

![Screenshot of the cPanel dashboard](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/pqwc2w_pCpGj2wj-8j-5hmFDkSfPhEeXzL6W8AKkb7VkCZYtBE7miPZnDhELL_rjqhDbMRs_iTG-d5Z_BTHyitUCo-9Hc717ujdXqvu4oExe_SNeYW1iDzXupQlE-NYtYxWrrLCzRZ0k8I3GOCo7c_k)

## Getting Started with Plesk

Plesk is a control panel designed to simplify web hosting management. It can easily be integrated with web applications like WordPress. 

You can access your Plesk account from the Liquid Web account dashboard. Inside the Plesk dashboard, you can choose between the Power User view or the Service Provider view. 

Power User should be used if you have one or a few more websites, while the Service Provider view is mainly for someone who manages a lot of sites and/or reseller services. Keep in mind that Power User is the default view once you log in for the first time. 

Plesk includes all the general features you'd need from a control panel plus the following:

You can log in to your WHM account by using the Liquid Web Account. Your WHM dashboard shows server management options and features. Though most of its features are for advanced users, you could easily learn them as you go along. 

Using WHM, you can change root passwords, configure backups, manage your accounts or create new ones, configure server security and firewall, and generate SSL certificates.

## Liquid Web Website Builder

### Beaver Builder

Liquid Web uses Beaver Builder and offers it for free to those who purchase managed WooCommerce hosting plans. It is fast, functional, and lightweight in many regards. 

You can choose from different templates and add different content to your layout by just dragging and dropping. It is very user and beginner-friendly.

### Nexcess Store Builder

You can also use the Nexcess Store Builder to create a WooCommerce store in no time. The choice is yours; you could use the built-in web builder or download a new one. 

The most common website builders are those that are compatible with WordPress sites.

### Liquid Web App and Software Installer

Using the cPanel server management dashboard, you can easily download the desired applications by using the Softaculous App Installer. 

If you are using Plesk, just go to the Applications tab for easy installation of web applications. When installing, you can choose from a list of different WordPress plugins as well. 

The WordPress app comes with thousands of WordPress themes that you can choose from. You can also use StellarWP for WordPress plugins and software. 

This is only available if you purchase the Managed WordPress Hosting plans.

### Liquid Web Customer Support

You can contact Liquid Web for support 24/7 via phone, chat, or email. All information about these can be found in the Contact Us tab. If you're in a rush, you could instantly begin a chat with their support team by clicking the Chat Now message found on every Liquid Web web page. 

Liquid Web claims that their agents respond in less than a minute and are quick to the task - I wanted to test this out for our Liquid Web review. 

Here's how our conversation went. The support person responded fairly quickly to my message. 

The response was personalized which means I was probably talking to an actual person, rather than an AI. 

All in all, they have excellent customer service with great support staff.

### Liquid Web Resources

Other than the customer support option I mentioned above, they also have a pool of articles, case studies, blogs, and webinars that you can use to your advantage. 

They are rich in content and contain information about their plans, methodology, and more.

The tutorials can be beneficial, especially for beginners, plus they also have plenty of visual media for you to truly catch everything they want to teach you.

![Screenshot of Liquid Web resources](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/t28yw8QqppozmuwkEk1rXG0MbUt8vihUhsah2e0SH_8yXIyCNESfY_lCtqwfW5U1RoXDu5nlB3x7i40QQpZV1IS4LcgzGIOgE_2IM6zfkj9tui97cDsXqgL95NruKwhCru8Er1ht35lqCJbx3Pyqy9w)

### Buyer's Guide for LiquidWeb

[Liquid Web](https://serp.ly/liquid-web-gpu-hosting) offers a wide array of services for you to choose from. In addition, you can also choose your desired management and support level.

![Screenshot of the Liquid Web Footer options](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/3wuk6yiI9oiovokZ7Oqj0UDLbJIfDFo32trPLYI7eLloIruCzIKNNke5ZwqyY-AezHr1_ZKky9kXsz2m3IPBlDuClJJfhQNdG5_0bbTgWEqE7Sa_ZeTchDlIOfvdJzMHbVVoDWxYycY2tbFzKqQy8F4)

### Management Levels

Fully managed servers come with a control panel from where you can manage everything on your account. You also gain access to everything that's related to helping users with issues, whether it's Liquid Web's support team or the resources and tutorials they offer. 

They will also perform the updates on the server that are necessary. With self and core-managed servers, you wouldn't get Liquid Web's full support system. 

This means the server would be managed only by you. It is best to get fully managed servers if you are a beginner.

### Plans and Pricing

Liquid Web is a premium hosting provider which means that they give excellent quality hosting solutions to their customers. 

As a web hosting elite provider, you can expect nothing less. Nexcess, StellarWP, and Liquid Web offer dedicated server hosting, cloud hosting packages, WordPress hosting plans, and more.

### Dedicated Server Hosting Plans

A dedicated server is a remote server exclusively dedicated to a single individual, organization, or business. It is not a shared web hosting plan, and as such, hosting is not shared with any other customers. 

Liquid Web servers come with tailored security, complete control over the system, resources, and other configuration options. Many hosting providers offer dedicated servers to their customers, but Liquid Web also offers managed hosting plans. 

Here, you can compare Liquid Web's dedicated hosting packs, and you can choose from the following servers:

- Intel Xeon 1230v6 - good for high traffic sites, multiple websites, small apps, and resellers

## Final Thoughts

Overall, Liquid Web is a very reliable web host. With 10 global data centers, fully managed cloud and web hosting, excellent support from 'Most Helpful Human' in Hosting, powering more than 45 000 customers and more than 500 000 sites under management, secure and hassle-free hosting, and great user reviews from different sites and its loyal customers, I can say that Liquid Web is not only reliable but also one of the most powerful web hosts in the field. 

Although it is a bit pricey compared to other hosting companies, be at peace with the fact that they've been successful for more than two decades.

We recommend going with [Liquid Web](https://serp.ly/liquid-web-gpu-hosting) for your web hosting needs though!
