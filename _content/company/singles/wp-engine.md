See the Buyer's Guide below to see WP Engine's plan, pricing, and full features. If you are starting small, this is a perfect plan for you.

After clicking the Get Started Button, I was redirected to the Checkout page. On this page, I get to choose my billing cycle, either annual or monthly. I prefer monthly billing since I am only trying to get a glimpse of how it works for now. You can choose a yearly billing cycle to get a massive discount from the WP Engine.

Also included on this page are the powerful add-ons you can select to enhance your plan and your website. The options include Smart Plugin Manager for $10 per month, Global Edge Security for $30 per month, additional sites for only $20 per month, and Genesis Pro for another $30 per month.

## WP Engine Website Builder

WP Engine as a managed WordPress host with only ten years of experience, must think of a way to get an edge over more established WordPress hosts.

WP Engine offers a local WordPress development tool you can use in building your website locally. You can easily download it on your PC, create your site online or offline, connect it with the WP engine, then push your site for staging or live.

Features included in Local are the following:

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5gtE0Lxxk-vvoguBKmeYWhvsbPDoZH71XThEttmgXAMLpvHC-TyWN8ubgpAJhDiiLryRHSN1Gb7qWBvaKPj0mYE8QHdpZCnnV8lUiURtS8Z-J_0sfL3KDYqOnp-tkyuOs9k71NzdZpGb5B7aVMkN5JM)

Local development comes with the following:

- Automatic WordPress installations, including WordPress software and plugin

- Advanced development features- offers root SSH access, WP-CLI, and PHP environments.

- MagicSync- recommends the site files to update and to sync

- Local Connect - Push and pull sites like Flywheel or WP Engine easily

- Live Links - lets you create a temporary URL to send to clients and coworkers without deploying your site.

- One-click admin- single username and passwords

- Cloud Backups - quickly push and pull sites from Local to Google Drive or Dropbox to keep your workspace clean at all times.

- Image Optimizer- compress image files offline and optimize the site for mobile view.

- Hot-swap environments - easily swap multiple PHP environments or try out the latest version of MySQL right from Local.

## WP Engine WordPress Themes

Genesis Pro and WP Engine offer free themes together with their hosting plans.

Genesis Pro is a [WP Engine](https://serp.ly/wp-engine) add-on plan that gives users access to advanced tools and features to make website building more straightforward and faster. These tools can be used for an unlimited number of sites, including those not hosted at WP Engine. You can access this from the User Portal.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/rUDeblDMvKO2A4IEhtRfJEYL68EUWmoYKzpn8JFMbC7Eu-RYQmfEII_ZnbERlV2LOIlLODEVDGCBQXDRoZstAkt-GcBfUCqVhfsOAB_Xlj4aA1CiAtQ28l5MQ8ExCeIKJ7lj-rht11nVluS3Qo5QpXo)

Inclusions are the following:

- Genesis Blocks - these are plugins containing libraries of web page-building blocks, sections, page layouts, and many more. It comes in two versions: Genesis Blocks, free for all WP Engine hosting plans, and Genesis Block Pro, which needs a subscription. The Pro version has more features than the free version, including premium blocks, full-page layouts, and many more.

- Genesis Custom Blocks Pro - this plugin makes it easy to create and build your custom blocks. You don't need to learn JavaScript code, but you need to know PHP, HTML, CSS, and block editor. Genesis Custom Blocks if for free, while the Pro requires payment. 

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ECpTtIsebxJPNUPEuCM0om_7Vh3GoQOZ_EXzevuaHQ_OLmkO0dtEiDFSyEEpJAu4CfCzLzmRauIszqsqk3vdepDy9rXpJ6iYTfKNTIWqpZCs_hTRzczUV677wF3vAR8C7xB-ixNJBVFmgTdSi-I1KWI)

- Genesis Framework- is used to control the codebase and functionality of the site. It is a secure, fast, and search-engine-optimized foundation for a WordPress site.

- StudioPress themes - are easy-to-use themes that work best with the Genesis Framework.

## WP Engine App Installer

Since WP Engine offers managed WordPress hosting only, all the apps offered are already pre-installed or can be installed with just a click of a button.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Nd6t13iSsResLB_nE9FXVucl8xX6DT8ayn1cyS2hPXE0itx37Mqq9F2k1qrV6ZjVvUuqG-WKVIn-2RiCAj_45FZLSEsG25NlehUKD_9oyKrNOZxvZFfPJPZl4_825xCFjHhtjzcaFtNFw0q1gYW-13o)

Installing WordPress themes in WP Engine is not something you should worry about. WP Engine's add-ons like Genesis, Atlas, and more, can be easily and quickly installed.

## WP Engine Customer Support

Customer support is undeniably a vital factor in choosing a web hosting company. WP Engine's support team is available via call, chat, or email. However, phone support is not available for all plans. Also included are some support articles you can read.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/aAAd_yfu7b-Zll6B4CM_igcuNAYL0ucD9kaxqSGVzAjxyN4kzYUayF_h6449hg66pWKS1k_SrBRj1GgSGMkTTRKx73VpDdlu66FnDJONQGpcKqH7OhvhyLnNcvDfxFS2cJ1CoSZ93BGKrOcP63elfsc)

I tried the live chat support feature. Unfortunately, they do not have support 24/7 on standby. I only talked to a bot, and it sent me support articles related to my question. My first question was about WP Engine's WordPress plans and the second one was about the WordPress installations. Both are answered by a bot only. It gave me a link to the support articles about the WP engine plans.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/NCiWC_yEEN5Pi2WeQ8ZuajyTNV5-a8pUFDI0x5roP47hGfKIFVMhc6rKqTv9-h6xUR2LKSzYEviRqrRg27PRrPDKQLAVaEIVQzlBjAvDiEf8mEZfAF06HGuH5R7ZXcA3fqjxCFV2KrfWwWFd3DGj6vY)

This could be a downside for those customers who have urgent business or issues that needs to be resolved. I suggest that for urgent matters, it is best if you use other means of communication.

## Final Thoughts

[WP Engine](https://serp.ly/wp-engine) as a web host is packed with features that could make your hosting life easier. All WP Engine plans come with an easy-to-use dashboard, excellent uptime, daily automatic backups, and many more. Although the WP Engine pricing is a bit expensive compared to other hosting providers, it offers free tools and add-ons to build your sites.

The WP Engine support is quite acceptable, though talking to a real person is not really 24/7. If your issues are not that urgent, you can use the available support articles and tutorials. They also have phone support and email support you can use instead.

Overall, my WordPress hosting WP Engine experience as my WordPress hosting provider was exquisite, and the reviews from its user online are excellent.

I hope this WP Engine review helped you in your web hosting journey!
