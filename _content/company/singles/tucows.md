## Overview

[Tucows](https://serp.ly/tucows) has been helping users leverage the Internet's full potential since 1993. Local download speeds were a major selling point for Internet service providers (ISPs) and other partner sites in the early days of the Internet.

Since then, they have expanded into domain registration, cellphone service, even symmetrical gigabit Internet access by utilizing their distribution methods and key skills.

Today, Tucows employs more than 700 employees and delivers Internet-related services to a wide range of consumers throughout the world.

But at heart of what they do is keeping people linked and the Internet accessible. EPAG, OpenSRS, Ascio, and Hover are the world's second- and third-largest domain registrars, respectively. As Ting Internet, they provide communities around the United States with access to the Internet's full potential.

They act as a Mobile Services Enabler (MSE), which means they put pressure on large networks to innovate and stay competitive with them. Information for investors: https://www.tucows.com/investors/ TCX (NASDAQ: TCX, TSX:TC) \[It's pronounced two-cows, by the way.\]

Mission: Those who work for them are a group of talented individuals who have a common belief in the potential of the open web. In order to improve the Internet, they labor at the foundation to develop both actual and virtual items.

Retail domain name registration was first introduced by them in 1999, and they've grown to be the world's second largest registrar. Domain names, email addresses, and digital security solutions are sold by OpenSRS and Enom through a global resale network of more than 37,000 Web enterprises to more than 24 million customers.

Hover simplifies the management of domain names & email addresses for individuals & small companies. In addition to being named one of Lifehacker's Five Best Domain Name Registrars, our user-friendly administration tools and superior customer service have earned us the loyalty of over 300,000 clients.

Because it provided individuals in the United States with smart, honest, and courteous phone service when they expected the reverse, Ting Mobile caused quite a stir when it launched in 2012. Nearly 300,000 people have currently signed up for the service.

Consumer Reports Magazine has continuously placed Ting Mobile as one of the best cellphone carriers, defeating Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile. Redefining what customers expects from an internet service provider, Ting Internet began delivering FTTP services in 2015.

Now, we can provide "crazy fast" fiber Internet in areas where the only other alternative is middling speeds given by old copper and cable. By now they have brought gigabit Internet to 10 different American cities and villages, with more on the way.

## Tucows Story

Changing not only how but also who could come online was Tucows' initial focus in 1993. They're not going to stop until they get their way on the Internet.

They collaborate with tens of thousands of resellers and administer tens of millions of domain names, ranging from.com to.xyz (OpenSRS, Enom, EPAG). They remove all of the unpleasantness from purchasing and controlling your domain & email address (Hover).

People's expectations for mobile phone service have been altered by their efforts (Ting Mobile). As they develop and light fiber-to-the-premises networks across North America, they're reshaping the way entire communities connect to and believe about the Internet (Ting Internet).

Many small, well-established companies make up this conglomerate. It has taken us 25 years to get to this point, but we're still a lengthy way from the finish line.[Tucows](https://serp.ly/tucows) Beliefs

## What Is Hover?

A spinoff of the ICANN-accredited domain name registrar Tucows, Inc. was created in 2009 as Hover Domains. A hallmark of the Hover strategy is a steadfast adherence to a narrow focus on domains.

Let's face it, you've probably only heard of Hello Internet or 99% Invisible through their podcast advertisements. Despite the fact that Grey and Roman may promote them, you're more interested in how they compare on their own.

The only thing this domain registrar does is buy, manage and transfer domains. However, Hover just provides email services; no web hosting, website builders, or the like are available via the company.

## Hover Pricing

Keep in mind that a domain is not the same as a website. A service that isn't a messaging app, email, or any other type of service. You may think of it as your web address. It helps others find your whereabouts.

Even if you don't require a website, you'll still need to purchase a domain name and a web hosting service which Hover does not provide. To comprehend Hover's purpose, we need to draw this difference before we go into the advantages and downsides of the service.

They're not trying to be a one-stop shop — just the contrary, in fact. They just care about keeping things simple. Getting your own domain and then being able to use it anywhere you want is the focus of their services, which include app integrations.

## Pros of Hover

Pros: Interface Hover's user interface is among the most intuitive in the industry. It's simple, straightforward, and easy to use. There's no mistaking where to begin with the domain search, which occupies the lion's share of the homepage real estate.

A clear list with a precise match and additional suggestions is shown when you search for a certain domain. Hover provides a plethora of leading domain selections but also provides an easy way to sort through them using different filter categories.

In addition, the checkout procedure is a breeze. I was able to move my domain from my basket to my dashboard in only four simple clicks. If you're looking for an easy-to-use domain name registrar like Hover, you won't be disappointed.

Pros: Variety of Different TLDs Website owners now have to ensure the domain registrar provides all the TLDs they desire (particularly if they're buying in bulk) now that ICANN accepts more TLDs than generic.com/.net/.org. For those looking for something a little more specific than generic domains, Hover provides a wide variety of TLDs to choose from.

They will have around 460 TLDs to choose from by the end of March 2020. There are a large number of country-specific names available through Hover, making it an excellent option if you need to purchase up domains for many nations or even cities.

Pros: Transparent Pricing Registrars provide a wide range of pricing options, ranging from low initial costs with high renewing rates to high initial costs with low renewal costs. When it comes to price, Hover has no qualms about being clear. Each TLD type includes a price breakdown in their table for purchase, renewals, and transfer.

Your personal information, such as your name and address, is shielded from spammers, advertisers, and anyone who may conduct a WHOIS lookup on your website. However, ICANN costs are not included in the rates, thus your total will need to be increased by $0.18.

If you have more than 10 domains registered with Hover, you can get a discount on your renewal fees. In their pricing table, you can see how the domain ranges are priced. Pros: Real-Time Support Hover is well-known for its exceptional customer service, even if I haven't had to deal with it personally.

They don't employ automated systems because they're anti-phone-tree, which they claim to be. You'll always be able to speak with a real person, whether you're calling, emailing, or chatting in real time. When it comes to availability, Hover has a full calendar.  You may reach them via phone, email, or live chat from Monday through Friday (8 a.m. to 11 p.m. ET) and Saturday and Sunday (8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET).

In addition to commonly asked questions & answers, the "Need Help" button on the site provides a link to their chat session and other help resources. Pros: Integrations There are several applications you may use with your Hover account, from website builders including Wix to eCommerce systems like Shopify, that allow for the easy integration of a domain name. Aside from the possibilities for integration, connecting your domain is a simple process.

Each program on Hover is explained in detail, making it simple even for non-technical website owners. Adding DNS records that connect your domain to your website platform will even be done for you by them. Pros: Data Protection When I was acquiring a domain with Hover, I was impressed by the lengths they took to secure my personal information.

There's nothing worse than acquiring a domain and instantly receiving spam emails or being retargeted by advertisements from all over the place. Hover takes a step farther than WHOIS privacy by allowing you to choose how your information is shared throughout the checkout process. After acquiring my domain, I was given an email asking me to update my data usage consent options, which I dutifully did.

## Cons of Hover

Cons: No Free Products Despite the fact that Hover focuses just on domains, this is a positive. There are a number of goods that nearly usually go with a domain. You'll need an SSL certificate for your domain if you wish to use SSL to secure your site.

You may buy it independently from a third company, however from my experience, maintaining it with the domain is better. I like to segregate my domains with hosting, however many website owners prefer to have their hosting & domains packaged together (even if it's not optimal from a performance standpoint).

GoDaddy and Namecheap both provide economical WordPress hosting with domains, but Namecheap is more competitive. In addition, the majority of web hosts provide free or discounted domain registration as part of the hosting package (such as InMotion Hosting or Bluehost). Hover does not provide these sorts of items.

Domain email is available, but you can't get a hosting plus website builder platform on the same site. If this is something that is important to you, you may want to explore elsewhere. Cons: High Pricing Hover's biggest negative is that they are more expensive than other registrars, despite the fact that this is a pro for them as a domain name registrar. When comparing pricing, Namecheap and Hover are two good options.

In addition to the ICANN price of $0.18, Namecheap will charge you $10.98 to register a.com name, which will then be renewed for $12.98. To get the same.com domain name with Hover, it will set you back $11.91 and renew for $14.99. Specialty top-level domains cause the price gap to widen even further. Find out how much Namecheap and Hover charge for this.condos domain name.

To save cash on a domain acquisition or renewal, there are better options than Hover if you don't mind the upsell/cross-sell that often comes with such registrars. Hover is a good option if you don't mind paying a little extra for a domain registrar that is clear and doesn't engage in cross-selling or upselling.

## Conclusion

An easy domain-buying and integration experience is what you're looking for?  You'll want a registrar with a ton of customer service options?  Your email and domain should be hosted by the same company? Complimentary items aren't necessary (besides email)? An excellent match for you would be Hover Domains.
