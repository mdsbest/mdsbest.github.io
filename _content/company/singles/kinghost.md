## KingHost Walkthrough

## Overview

[KingHost](https://serp.ly/kinghost/) web solutions offers a wide range of tools to help you get your idea or company online quickly and affordably, with outstanding features and the ability to speed up your website with their Litespeed Server. KingHost has devoted itself to offering Web Hosting assistance to small, medium, and big enterprises, but also personal websites, to clients all over the world, particularly in Nigeria. We have indeed been effective in the website hosting sector because of our reasonable price and excellent customer service.

KingHost is dedicated to providing the quickest and most reliable hosting solution at the lowest available price. To do this, we must continue to innovate, embrace emerging technology, and upgrade our services on a regular basis without hurting our customers' pricing.

We stand behind our 14-day Money Back Assurance at KingHost because we know you'll appreciate our safe web hosting solutions! If you ever believe that we have been not upholding our half of the contract, or if you just wish to contact us personally, We really hope that KingHost will be your next and final web hosting supplier!

### Features and Usability

KingHost provides a wide range of web hosting and value-added services. Their hosting plans packages, which were also the initial service they provided when they started in 2006, are their most popular products. The most basic shared server package includes the following features:

- One webpage is hosted.

- SSD storage of 10GB

- Memory: 256MB

- 50GB of storage and unlimited email accounts

- MySQL databases having 5GB of storage are unlimited.

- Bandwidth is limitless.

- SSL Certificate from Let's Encrypt

- KingHost's own website builder is available for free.

- Backups every day

Several websites under your subscription, twice the RAM for every level up, greater storage capacity, and more value-added services like Varnish Cache & AntiSpam Free email security are all available with a higher-tier plan. One of KingHost's unique features would be that they compensate you by being a loyal customer.

When you cover your hosting plans subscription on time, you get weekly bandwidth and email storage incentives, which may easily add up to 1.27 GB each year. The above policy is applicable to their market price proposals, even though the rewards attributed have been provided in percentage change instead of a specific value.

KingHost has a typical uptime of 99.91 percent, that is above normal for a web host but not exceptional. When I ping them from a Brazilian site, server performance was outstanding, but considering that their cloud services are all in Brazil, this may suffer from other places.

Users may manage their accounts using KingHost's own control panel. This was simple to use, well-organized, and pretty extensive; I could examine my resource utilization, set up SSL certification, and access databases.

### Support and Pricing

In comparison to their rivals, KingHost's quoted pricing is comparable and affordable. Overall, I found KingHost to be more generous in terms of features and resources than most of the competitors, especially when considering their KingBonus incentive program.

However, I should tell you that KingHost's first cost is lowered for new customers; during the first year, the rates for successive renewals will climb dramatically, and those who don't read the small print are likely to be surprised.

To be honest, I didn't like how they went about it, especially since price levels more than doubled in the first year. When you consider the price rise, KingHost's packages aren't any longer as reasonable as the competitors. The prices are all given in the Brazilian Real, which is the native currency.

The current exchange rate is around 1 Real to.29 US cents. When you convert the prices, they are rather affordable. You'll realize that you're getting a good value for the kind of hosting you're receiving.

In fact, if you are not from Brazil, you might find it problematic, but it is not an issue for local users. [KingHost](https://serp.co/go/kinghost/) provides chat features, email, as well as a Brazilian phone hotline service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

Though being linked to an agent took a few minutes, live chat seemed responsive enough. Customers from outside Brazil should be aware that their hotline is not a toll-free number, therefore dialing from an outside Brazil may result in international phone charges.

### Tech Support Appears to Be Very Helpful

A web hosting service is required to keep a web page accessible on the internet. We provide the greatest plans & services for sites, blogs, and numerous apps at KingHost. Building a website and regularly updating its content is an excellent approach to promote your company or ideas.

In addition to allowing connections with the other platforms, including such database and access statistics, the hosting options offered allow you to build email messages with your own domain name. Hosting providers, or firms who provide this sort of service, provide these plans.

### What is the price of KingHost?

KingHost has plans ranging at $4 to $8. The cost is determined by the type of hosting package you select. The most recent price table (updated weekly) may be seen below.

### Which of the KingHost plans should I choose?

My advice is to begin with a less expensive package. Later on, you may always upgrade. KingHost can assist you in making the switch to a more costly plan. Many times, the spike in visitors takes longer than predicted, so don't spend so much money until the necessity comes. Of course, your requirements may differ, and you may seek advice from a KingHost hosting professional.

### What is the quality of Kinghost's customer service?

KingHost is not one of our recommended web hosts. However, this might be due to Kinghost's status as a modest, under-the-radar hosting company. A small hosting business has a benefit in that you, as a client, are more valuable to them.

### Pros

- Weekly information & email storage incentives

- Their servers are among Brazil's fastest.

- Above-average availability

- There are several value-added services available.

- Disk Space in Abundance

- Shared Databases on Solid State Drives

- Website that is simple to navigate.

### Cons

- Plan discounts are only applicable for the first year.

- Only Brazil has server farms and support workers.

- No guarantee of uptime

- The prices are in Brazilian Reals.

## How does KingHost compare to its competitors?

- Bluehost (2.5)

- InterServer (4.8)

- Hostinger (4.9)

- KingHost (4.5)

[KingHost](https://serp.ly/kinghost) is an excellent solution for websites targeting a Brazilian audience. Users should, however, be wary of price increases over the first year. KingHost may provide decent service at a fair price, but can it compete with the best web hosting providers? It's difficult for us to say "yes." The site and services are both simple to use.

Their website is really user-friendly. Even with translated English, it's simple to understand what you're getting and to browse all of your alternatives.

I couldn't communicate with the technical support since I don't know the language, but they appear to be really helpful and polite. This firm provides cPanel, the most popular control panel software that is also very simple to use.

## Area Focus

### Service Priority

- Hosting of a Website

### Client-centered

- Small Business( less than $10M)

- Medium Business($10M to $1B)

- Large Business( greater than $1B)

### Industry Concentration

- Music, Entertainment and Art

## Customer Feedbacks

"Based in Brazil, KingHost is an award-winning hosting company. They make it a point to inform consumers that they are based in the United States and because they have Brazilian technical support. This is a solid sign that they have a certain target demographic in mind, so if you need hosting in this area, companies are likely to provide. In 2013, 2014, and 2015, they were named one of Brazil's "100 Best Companies that Work For" in the IT category. This is amazing, because happy staff typically equate to excellent service. To fulfill the demands of the majority of individuals, they provide shared hosting, cloud hosting, and dedicated servers. They also provide reseller plans, site construction tools, domain registration, and other services. Overall, they've done a fantastic job of putting together a variety of high-quality services to fulfill their clients' demands." - Michael Levanduski 

"When you visit KingHost's website, you'll see that they provide an almost limitless host of options for your organizing needs. If you require something other than hosting, they provide a variety of possibilities. The business appears to be well-run, which is a plus. They are liberal with stuff like disk space and traffic, but the pricing is a little high. In the end, I would suggest them to anyone seeking a place to stay in Brazil." - Michael Taylor 

"[KingHost](https://serp.ly/kinghost) can help with just about anything you need to set up and operate an efficient website, thanks to their vast choice of hosted packages and value-added services." Since its start in 2006, they've served almost 300,000 websites and achieved substantial market share in Brazil."- Gwen Rodgers

## Conclusion

This is a wonderful firm to consider whether you need web hosting for your personal website or your company in Brazil. They've been providing high-quality web hosting for years and continue to do so in the future.
