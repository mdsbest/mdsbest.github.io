## Getting Started With JustHost

To start, head to the [JustHost](https://serp.ly/justhost) website. 

![JustHost home page](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-UHCJUB-psgxH1HJqfNi8yQIbAC1edjmDwtCr0KOsmnEcMAx4wkWJ4SBDnS9W-7Nh2Gu6gRF0dbW2mxjxM6zWV17M8PVD0slnTcl9Z1AdNyf_1DJykB6KabMSfninGYdfAFF--TIGLSiyAbxue6jD2k)

Here, you will be greeted with a pretty simple homepage, with their special introductory price upfront along with the hosting features it has and a few freebies below. Here's an overview of JustHost's hosting plans: Shared Hosting - a cPanel shared hosting plan

![Shared hosting plans](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mssEb9trAK7ELH1D2vdfCX4dBCMB2HUcMZyguwO4z28aiIVQCmFPfe_U56WKmU26hDSxProNCKJ-NlwnXwm0R23fq6c-szgPJv2QgSz1sMopCevhUYheoykD_e_6rWKiHhEfQU3oXBfOVvDltErV19Y)

Note: You can find the VPS Hosting and Dedicated Hosting options in the footer of their homepage. VPS Hosting - high-performance VPS Hosting 

![VPS Hosting types](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gvSaZssuwo3I0lO2wsCYoCTtqjhAOkoWMdahIA-zhB9gA4XoJCwkEeJatt-IbmvHjlhWgX5eHIB1-lD2TWNu2h3pfAxdGt0wI6UIMICX7t-9fZrrN_0MIbEDU2CiIM_lOyZATpneTlxJLOm9PEVldz4)

Dedicated Hosting - a fully-managed Dedicated Server Hosting package 

![Dedicated Hosting types](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/XxahelxtMujiVNuFqwsTDoDgN9vjdNc5WMwEVPIm1vj2lh_G2Xa9Tc58Hwov-bafe-XmPYxCtfCMDR-AntpUJYr1stb8JWwIz24n3LBqlN86LP30u_Mfx67A8xs3rgaUzJx6FacBG7twMUCv9-yGlpY)

For this JustHost review, we'll go for their Shared Hosting Basic plan. 

With this plan, you get to host one website, 50GB of website space, unmetered bandwidth, standard performance, free SSL certificate, free domain, five parked domains, twenty-five subdomains, five email accounts, and 100MB of email storage. 

Overall, you'll get some nice guaranteed server resources for building a WordPress website. Once you have decided which hosting service you want, click Select. 

![JustHost domain setup](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/vX4VD9ZzPKm8lHZybAMgGvmeZOn3ml0pKSrhk7v1rwmpXpQHEoURdwqXQc9e99f6MSd-mJ6hDCpKUPa5MO2l2E9cbAqcZL2CkhOkxc7ejPjpf29aUGv7XZfUdI2qf5SWxpdORnqF-eTgP2e1exabYOQ)

This will take you to the domain setup page. As the page name suggests, you can set up your domain here, or if you already have one, transfer it to JustHost. Once you've established your domain, click on Next. 

![Account creation](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/bErsWY5Xijd3NKy4IglCtBShjdtI-fIFkCyzDHipOAYg6H6anfC-nHIdA0dgkaFCt3X3QP3ih4XlfnzbMr3MVfsXhXaxwWkADSyP09j4WIC-WpW9KD1D1z4Ou6n9GAljnN8wl6Xtqf-dFn5Z94whoq8)

The next step would be to set up your account. Here, you can do it manually - type in your name, address, phone number, and email.

Or you can go for the easier account set up, which would be signing up with Google. In general, you can have multiple accounts for multiple websites.

 Personally speaking, I prefer hassle-free sign-ups, so doing it through Google was the obvious choice. 

![Package information](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/4H5iAhHPtdN3H_FuIMLDJzQAEQ4rtFGGg62QKMYGabSEGUk-8XjUFz88EofdDr9VGajN98dLeSB4qD_DptnyLOuMGPKUXoMsjGFv7zKCumkDKrQL2crNl61seyldznvhagtwSbvfx1jThoucBd8iSAM)

As you browse down this page, you'll notice two tabs: Package Information and Package Extras. You can select an annual, biannual, or triannual billing period here. 

Furthermore, in the Package Extras section, you may purchase additional protection and plugins to keep your site running smoothly, including Domain Privacy, CodeGuard, SEO tools, SiteBackup Pro, and SiteLock Security. 

![Payment information](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/HfTv3Lu_-Q6VR8GknnYgJlZFfkKsU4wG-SLHeymPfcxBjqX1qBQQu622A15bmiigEnmvhNYFtlkmftOca6xeUUDYhJy3_ujsG8xxwW3kunlcZKCZejXRBoL6FO-FCJmzmBSr3N1sN6fhVHjqYva_ing)

The Payment Information tab comes next. JustHost accepts two payment methods: credit card and PayPal. Once you've input the required information, click next to proceed with the web hosting process. 

After signing up for a JustHost account, you should get your account information via email. Your hosting account will be ready to use within a few minutes if the order application is accurate and complete. 

The email will contain some useful information regarding website building and web hosting, so make sure to go through the info properly.

## Using and Managing Your Website on JustHost

The Login button is located in the upper right corner of the JustHost home page. Alternatively, you can simply click [here](https://serp.ly/justhost)! 

![JustHost log in screen](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/dfdCQfD_VfGQmWzLzyJPZO68vHgjfuboP9rnVP-TpQj6cQGGU8esP5Z1pEyyqUDzG9eOPBxR_C9SR-OueuT2xMWZSje_QyPZ3MyYc6Qg2FGiat79pi_fZwLwZU8DEBVBCbowDQ0UqxlegkH8riaKDXI)

As with any other log-in process, you must enter the credentials given to you by JustHost through email. When logging in, you have two options: Hosting Login and Webmail Login.

After successfully logging in, you will be taken to the account dashboard. You will find a variety of options for managing your accounts here such as emails, websites, files, disk space, site builder, and more.

## JustHost Control Panel

A control panel is included with each JustHost package. You'll get the cPanel interface; however, JustHost has made certain changes to make the overall product even easier to use. 

This is beneficial for small business owners that require an easy-to-use tool to manage their web hosting account. Additionally, customer satisfaction plays a big role in how successful many web hosting providers are, so naturally, JustHost has made this their priority.  

Ultimately, the control panel is your one-stop shop for anything connected to the hosting of your site.

### Marketing

The Marketing section comprises mostly of e-commerce, advertising, and SEO tools - suitable for those who wish to start a small online business without purchasing additional tools to boost their online presence.

### Email

![Email options](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/X_FLn9xNIv8JShCEZHRDk-bq0q9oBWCgfQbcgdxQAN1Yitjh7Jt2_q41pCR3nesFq8y6_LPUhRAhBtF1VaqQL6aK_X1qUcjbfSHapLvWIPtcvzrs6rTMOi9oRsrVtxeS0bTIrKxk3qsPaI6cR1ww91I)

The option to create customized email accounts for each domain is one of the advantages of hosting your website with a cPanel-enabled web host. 

All of this happens in the Email section of cPanel. As you can see, there are various tools available, such as those for creating new emails, configuring forwarders and autoresponders, dealing with spam, and more. 

Access to an email server is included in your JustHost hosting plan. You can create email accounts with your website's domain name, a free web-based email client, or an email program.

### Website

![Website tools](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/0oxneSSFkytbcRSe7ixb0NYoZeV-C5QJ_W-PC9IHBo_RzTlpaYga6fPDa-_rpy3KlT1XOgwizP2ryiTZSMGVuUHP9L_8KdvF3N3ZJAv-j1bQPaU3Td7e9EXpB9dmFOh77KyFjf2q4qPjXsK5H0MmNQc)

If you would like to add a new domain name, manage your existing domains and domain name, or set up subdomains, the Domains area of cPanel is where you can do all these.

### Files

![File options](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/XOV2A3Jn1EShMiWZfsMKP0Ij8yLQGT-ZNeImqcL97k_yI7b_RbFInCqAiEqCHBiTJ-jaMEHGpZ8wogE8xuZKjQMg_8NEOp1mkgWs8JnUqB4FCD-9JrFZW8QoKsm513HmDWqHMCk0Rn35jEf2iCwWtR0)

Numerous modern websites would struggle to exist without a database, which works quietly behind the scenes to handle the website's content. Simply said, the database contains all of the data on your website, including all pages, posts, and user information.

As you may expect, cPanel contains a powerful tool for establishing and maintaining databases.

### Programming

![Programming tools](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/559VmtlHeaZ94s89-m6JNYIDcwrqJ_VHjsb-GcMOmbAsCQkT2mem5kBTjdx9_DHBbhqglYxujzqMqXtUyxq4mBjoHoiBWcLY_1gUeFOlTcRbVlFeHqv1H2JLvj7eiyGB_nunPpjNETBS3nsgzpkeOlY)

## JustHost Website Builder

Setting up your website with JustHost is simple once you've chosen a hosting package. JustHost provides two website creation tools by default: Weebly and WordPress. 

![Weebly](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/QC10sgT9K09PBsZ6fa_5GID6DHUjT2n8fCEcfQzqmC1Wkx_PLdApgbVk3oBlE3Xf039hUnPF1nPl2uQlBmHDuazK1HwrriSab8y6cD7QrVQ7n80B8DM3JD-2qN2z3CtACxqdka7eb5b0aDdjZsNExyQ)

With regard to website building, you get all of the benefits of the company's shared hosting packages, including free domain registration, unlimited email accounts, unlimited data transfer, e-commerce shopping carts, and cPanel, which improves accessibility even more. 

In addition, for commercial customers, the accompanying $150 in advertising credits will assist in getting your new website recognized. 

JustHost is designed for first-time users and is incredibly easy to use. 

[JustHost](https://serp.ly/justhost), which includes a free domain name and quick installation, gets you up and running as well as creating your website in moments rather than waiting for the servers to be configured for you.

### Apps Installer

You may go to the Mojo Marketplace and find dozens of “one-click install” software like OpenCart, Drupal, and Joomla, to mention a few. 

![Mojo Marketplace](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_EFapOOdvXx9Lyy6O6qyKjBeiNZoB5W1BmwA5TVymuiKLR0QMzMGnGeklkkSbJNYbQ_sRvZURVoji_RdYLUlqrfNINDI8eflf64-5jeyhN3geV8dy-_JP9S7y_cDbvJ4UJGAewc8FRhpO-ziRVXRXFs)

Despite the lack of WordPress-specific enhancements, site owners employing the world's most popular content management system are well served by the JustHost's sufficient resources and solid infrastructures. 

JustHost offers unlimited bandwidth, free domain registration, and one-click WordPress installation through the Mojo Marketplace script library.

## WordPress Themes

Since JustHost does not provide WordPress-specialized hosting plans, you may install WordPress using Mojo Marketplace, which has over 8,000 free themes in a variety of designs and categories. However, if you wish to start from the ground up, you are welcome to do so.

## JustHost Customer Support

A good web hosting provider will go above and beyond to assist you in determining how to improve your site's quality while troubleshooting frequent difficulties as they arise. This is particularly true if you are not the most technically savvy person on the planet.

As with any other review, we had to put their customer support team to the test in order to cement our opinion. 

In this JustHost review, we contacted them via live chat support and asked a few questions. Now the question is, are they reliable enough? 

This is how it went: 

![JustHost technical support response](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UN3Uu2ih2p5WPGq5z2661rynfX5rppxJA8jAfu8E7JDZbnd1iHzFlZuXPUJ2TdexyEocXyptHkEzcefPR8ooZ-pdHpRw8excC6_YqXk6R9VKlgdQu3jP1tT53nfEtT_-9zQ4OFEYgWWxcTFdpq2mNFo)

The customer rep responded in less than a minute. 

![JustHost technical support response follow-up](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/lsohjhn5L2vFdM302LRSoshRKjTbH6QHYZwtITKtlNOjwEZ5gmHdCsaM6X4YAhmxIYcyfr5G37L6UTIdPNMjWctmfOjQMzVLrEKQcNeMeg8exHjEwEO1XoJombbhF29orVBLiFhR7Zt8kg5Q56vdj5I)

Although they were very responsive, they asked me a lot of questions, so I did not proceed with the rest of the conversation. On a brighter note, it's good to know that they ask these questions to really help me find the best fit for hosting my website. Let's give JustHost's customer support a thumbs up!

## Buyer’s Guide For JustHost

### Plans and Pricing

Shared Hosting plans start at $3.95/month. 

![Shared hosting plans](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/udRhyQCLfr1shz2PIc1LmAKbomI2t9QT71gWHfcRgCoVuUsHZt-ol3B_rAmN8WTgVg86WzDxtZGyAAgXeVkkVWzQxVfZCqO1B7LDu0QAV2OJNxCmIyD9I-U_cq3E5imaCEqbwQ3G4memxmkWcJMjg5I)

Shared hosting is the cheapest type of web hosting service. Several websites share the resources of a single server, which for many is enough to keep their small or medium-sized websites running. Shared hosting plans start at $3.49 per month for a promotional offer. 

Renewal fees begin at $9.49 per month. 

They are billed in 12, 24, or 36-month cycles. Those that sign longer commitments are eligible for reductions on their monthly hosting rates. Those that sign up for a 36-month contract, on the other hand, pay the least for hosting on a month-to-month basis. VPS Hosting plans start at $19.99/month.

VPS hosting is comparable to shared hosting, except instead of a resource pool from which your site and all the other sites hosted on that server can take, each website receives its own distribution of resources. 

Your site cannot draw resources from any other allocation, nor can any other website draw resources from your site. Standard, Enhanced, Premium, and Ultimate are the four Virtual Private Server hosting plans available. 

Depending on the hosting plan you select, your website could be hosted on a server with a dual, triple, or quad-core processor. JustHost offers four VPS hosting plans with introductory rates starting at $19.99 a month. The renewal rates start at $29.99. Dedicated Hosting plans start at $79.99/month.

Dedicated hosting plans are by far the most costly option provided by JustHost. A dedicated server is one in which all of the server's resources are allocated to hosting only one site. Nobody else is putting a strain on the available disk space, RAM, bandwidth, and so on. 

Additionally, because you usually have no software constraints, you can install anything you want and customize your server any way you want. The other lower-level dedicated server alternatives, Standard and Enhanced, are less expensive. Still, the feature sets are not as good as what you receive with a Premium JustHost dedicated server. 

The highlights of JustHost's dedicated server offers are the company's sophisticated hardware and multiple dedicated IP addresses. JustHost is a wonderful choice for a first-time user's dedicated server because each server is fully managed with an expanded cPanel. 

Yet, experienced users who want to administer or modify all elements of their servers retain root access. Instant provisioning is a highly valued and unique capability for dedicated servers, which can frequently take hours to configure and deploy. 

Furthermore, all storage includes RAID-1 protection and storage upgrades of up to 2TB. JustHost offers three dedicated server hosting plans starting at $79.99 a month and renews at $109.99 a month.

### Server Speed and Uptime

In 2018, HTML's server speed test revealed an average server response time of 1,252 milliseconds. Yet, JustHost's server response time improved in December 2018 and averaged 746 milliseconds in the first four months of 2019. 

That is a major improvement, but it is still significantly slower than some of its competitors in the low-cost hosting market. Uptime is fundamental; you cannot anticipate people to visit your website if it takes too long to load and is frequently unavailable. 

Therefore, you must use a web host that offers good uptime, or you will lose potential consumers and subscribers. JustHost claims 99.9% uptime; however, several testing sites indicate that JustHost has had 99.95% in the last 30 days, which is pretty impressive. 

The company's data center is in Chicago, Illinois, and it is equipped with diesel generators and UPS power backup. They have almost 2,000 servers in their data center, and all of their hardware and software is maintained by technicians 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

### Security and Backups

JustHost is a reputable web host service provider since they provide a variety of security features. They ensure that all of your data is safe from viruses, malware, and Trojan attacks. 

JustHost backup your website's data for free; an upgraded plan that backs up all folders and files is also available for $19.99 per year. You may also acquire an SSL certificate to make financial transactions more secure, starting at $69.99 per year. 

SiteLock, which detects for and removes malware, costs $19.99. Anti-spam tools are also available.

## Final Thoughts

[JustHost](https://serp.ly/justhost) offers numerous freebies, making the shared hosting provider an excellent value. The basic plan is relatively inexpensive, and the best rates are reserved for those who sign up for a 12-36-month commitment. 

However, if you wish to test out their web hosting services, they have a 30-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked. Therefore, you won't lose your money if you decided to switch to other hosts. 

Do we recommend them? Somewhat; better web hosting providers are available out there that offer everything you need and are also relatively cheaper. 

But, if you don't mind the few drawbacks of JustHost, this web hosting provider is a good choice, especially for mid-level websites that don't require top-of-the-line dedicated servers. 

We hope this review has been useful in finding your web hosting company!
