If you have never used an eLearning platform before, you might not know what to look for as a customer or content creator.

With the expansion of eLearning opportunities and remote work, platforms such as [LearnWorlds](https://serp.ly/learnworlds/) are essential for course creation, sharing online courses, or making online school and online work accessible.

If you are not all that convinced that eLearning is the route you want to take, let us convince you otherwise!

eLearning is a fantastic option for course creators to share an online course consistently so that every student and every employee has equal access to information.

![](/images/ffd13afc-49ff-4cd7-9765-949d7f317af2.png)

Plus, we all know we need solid accessibility to information, especially in this day and age. People are working from home now more than ever, and opportunities for students to engage in remote learning are growing every day, so this is a perfect time to get into online content.

With efficient resources and an accessible interface, your students and employees can happily access online course platforms from the comfort of their own homes and they can complete the online courses at their own pace. With that, meet the platform: [LearnWorlds](https://serp.ly/learnworlds/).

## What is LearnWorlds?

To know what they're all about, refer to the LearnWorlds mission statement:

"Our vision is to be rewarded for creating learning products that provoke authentic, comprehensive, continuous, creative, and challenging learning experiences. We want future learning, now."

![](/images/034890b2-cc6a-4083-81aa-5d808a10950b.png)

LearnWorlds is a learning management system (LMS). LMS is simply a fancy term for software that can target your specific eLearning needs with versatile course pathways and various tools, interactive elements, and advanced features, depending on the purpose.

For this specific program, LearnWorlds is an LMS platform that provides all the essential tools for creating course content and selling your courses online.

Using cloud-based technology, LearnWorlds provides customizable web building technology for employee or student training, with engaging courses and customer support, so that you can build an online community of accessible eLearning.

With LearnWorlds, you can create the classes available for sale and then sell those online courses at your leisure. The customer service team provides all the tools necessary for your eLearning success.

## Who is LearnWorlds For?

LearnWorlds is appropriate for a few different audiences, but overall, it is best for those seeking affordable training services, either as a creator or student.

The two main audiences include those who design a LearnWorld and those who partake in LearnWorld.

### Those Who Design a LearnWorld

Individuals who want to design a LearnWorld can be any of the following:

- Entrepreneurs
- Teachers/Principals
- eLearning companies
- Corporate trainers
- Content Creators

These people would be looking to sell online courses. This may include but is not limited to anyone who wishes to teach a certain skill set, lead a certification course, or create a teachable experience in an effort to educate others.

**Entrepreneurs**

Starting your business from scratch might be complex, but it does not need to be complicated. Keep all your systems on one eLearning platform to ensure consistency and technology-friendly lessons.

![](/images/ad0da5a0-628c-4a3b-8fca-eaac40ab2268.png)

**Teacher or Principals**

LearnWorlds might just be a perfect choice for a teacher or principal who wishes to design a stunning online school that meets the flexibility and accessibility as well as the educational needs of all of their students.

![](/images/1972b0eb-29ab-4a0e-854c-ce79dd179568.png)

#### **eLearning Companies**

Those with dedicated web hosting opportunities who are looking to educate customers can use LearnWorlds to sell courses and teach marketing tools appropriate for corporations that do not wish to design their own LearnWorlds platform.

![](/images/1bdd76f6-fb3c-408f-a4e4-eeda20c12bfe.png)

**Corporate Trainers**

This can cover a lot of ground. For instance, some corporate trainers may be looking to instruct employees through learner engagement using digital courses to conduct onboarding, orientation, compliance training, sexual harassment training, or product knowledge training, to name a few.

![](/images/49acd873-e67e-48b1-be5a-f9db84042a1a.png)

**Content Creators**

If you are a content creator or professional with a specialized skill and wish to create a video library of free online courses, or you wish to host online courses regarding your knowledge, you can do that with LearnWorlds.

![](/images/50a02438-6b31-4a7a-accd-5c02bce647b5.png)

### Those Who Partake in LearnWorlds

Individuals who partake in LearnWorlds include but are not limited to:

- Human resources (HR) professionals looking to buy learning tools
- Students
- Individuals seeking online courses

**Employers**

Perhaps as a corporate employee or HR professional, you do not intend on creating online courses but would prefer to purchase a good online course to conduct this training.

LearnWorlds course platforms give you the opportunity to access unlimited courses, interactive videos, and a dedicated support team so that you can meet the needs of your employees.

![](/images/8318c8e4-1f66-4361-9582-032b50bb7dc9.png)

**Students**

If you are a student, you might not realize that you are learning via a LearnWorlds platform. You are simply enjoying a smooth, user-friendly eLearning platform! At least, that's the hope.

![](/images/4b79ab34-b585-48b0-b4f9-7e1ee4414daf.png)

**Individuals**

Likewise, if you are an individual interested in learning new skills, you can take advantage of all the features LearnWorlds offers in order to expand your knowledge of any given program or platform that you want to learn.

![](/images/b29de540-f049-4cac-b4c4-8932b0628f51.png)

## Pricing For Your Site

Naturally, pricing will vary depending on your particular need.

Whether you want to provide free courses, run an affiliate program and learn affiliate management, or create a large user-friendly platform for education, your price point will matter.

How much does LearnWorlds cost? Each plan will involve different pricing. Let's get into the details.

There are four main plans you can choose from when selecting what will work best for you. Of course, price matters. Our LearnWorlds review would not be complete without transparency about price points.

Online school is a reality of our times. Remote learning is likely not going anywhere soon, and even if it is not the standard, it is a good accessible, flexible alternative for students who need it.

The plan package you select should be able to meet all of your needs. The LearnWorlds course providers have created three main options when it comes to plan options, as mentioned in the pricing section.

You are essentially building the educational world you wish to see for your company. Be patient and take pride in your work. When you do that, you make it easier on yourself.

**If You're Still Nervous**

Maybe you're thinking "I still don't know what half of these words mean!"

![](/images/2c98974e-20ad-4b63-8b31-19f52cbf5331.png)

Well, you're not alone. Learning the lingo for content creation involves a bit of a learning curve, but it's totally possible.

Plus, in this LearnWorlds review, we're ready to clarify the words you need to know to effectively utilize the site.

1. What is a pop-up builder?
2. If you've heard of pop-up blockers, you might be wondering about pop-up builders. Seems counterintuitive, right? Well, building pop-ups gives you the ability to create advertisements and market your business.
3. What is an SSL certificate?
4. SSL stands for a secure sockets layer–in other words, a security system that helps authenticate your website, basically providing validity for your site and encrypting the connection.
5. What is a drip feed?
6. A drip feed allows you to provide content to your users on a steady basis, rather than providing all the information at once. That way, your users will not have access to everything at once and they will have a good reason to come back for more!
7. What is API?
8. API stands for application programming interface and it is software that helps your computer become compatible with other software services.
9. What are webhook integrations?
10. On any of your landing pages, you can create webhook integrations that automatically send information to different parts of your site and server. Webhook integrations are similar to API but they are not the same.
11. What are optional SLAs?
12. SLA stands for service level agreement and they are used for customer agreements and internal agreements.

And most importantly...what is LearnWorlds Academy?

## LearnWorlds Academy

We've been speaking quite broadly about all the offerings that LearnWorlds provides, but let's get a little more specific. Let's talk about education and the ways you can be a part of online schooling!

As LearnWorlds Academy suggests, "Learn How to Monetize your Knowledge, Teach people Online and Create a Beautiful online School from Scratch."

Verified users have created schools such as the following...

### Success Story Schools

- School of Calisthenics
- Learning Liaisons
- Virtual Kenpo
- The Jar Method
- The Pause Platform
- NailARTS
- Frocks and Frolics

On the LearnWorlds Academy [website](https://serp.ly/learnworlds/), you can even review these creators' course contents and check out each case study for free, as an inspiration or a blueprint.

If you are curious about any of the schools listed above, visit the website and discover more about these success stories and the ways in which these creators organized their schools.

Learn more about the tools that successful creators use to overcome common obstacles, and you may even feel inspired by the ways in which these creators have surpassed various challenges.

With such a support team available to lead by example, you will figure out what you need to do to _just start!_

## How To Use Integration Tools

Now that you know the lingo, this LearnWorlds review is about to get into the different integration tools.

![](/images/247190e6-1acd-40e2-b6e2-8922a4126d95.png)

People always like to tell you _what_ you should do, but rarely ever tell you _how_ to go about it. That's what we're here for!

### Virtual Infinite Marketing and Affiliate Tools

What the _heck_ is virtual infinite marketing? Well, it's just a fancy term for unlimited marketing possibilities...online.

Likewise, what are affiliate tools? Well, Shopify (one of the LearnWorlds integration options) said it best:

"[Affiliate marketing](https://devinschumacher.com/affiliate-marketing/) involves referring a product or service by sharing it on a blog, social media platform, podcast, or website. The affiliate earns a commission each time someone makes a purchase through the unique link associated with their recommendation."

And, what _are_ integration tools? Well, for example, rather than creating your own check-out process, you can use a finance integration tool, such as Paypal, to make any transaction easier.

LearnWorlds makes different integration tools available and categorizes them by a few different topics: finance, video, email marketing, customer service, growth, analytics, etc.

**Finance Integration Tools**

- Quaderno
- Bancontact
- iDeal
- PagSeguro
- Paypal
- Stripe

**Video Integration Tools**

- Wistia
- Vimeo

**Email Marketing Integration Tools**

- Covertkit
- Aweber
- Active campaign
- Mailchimp

**Customer Service Integration Tools**

- Tawk.to
- Olark
- Zendesk
- FreshChat

**Growth Integration Tools**

- Hubspot
- Sumome
- Intercom

**Analytics Integration Tools**

- Facebook pixels
- Mixpanel
- Google tag manager
- Google search verification
- Google analytics

**Other Integration Tools**

- Video Conferencing and Webinar: Webex and Zoom
- Marketing: Zapier
- Affiliates: Referral candy
- Social Proof: Fomo
- SSO & API: Auth0
- eCommerce: Shopify

These integration tools also give you the opportunity to explore customizable API and they even allow you to establish webhook delivery data, which is super important for organizing your platform as best as possible.

If you are curious about bringing additional apps or services to the table, talk to customer services about including those in your plan.

For example, if you are super familiar with particular software that is used to design interactive videos, request a consultation and see if you can take advantage of that in your platform.

What's better than putting your best foot forward and creating the best landing page possible? Don't let these options limit you–as the saying goes, ask \[about more apps\] and you shall receive.

## Resources

We already discussed LearnWorlds Academy, but there are a ton of additional resources we didn't cover yet. LearnWorlds provides some free resources to benefit your eLearning needs.

## LearnWorlds History

LearnWorlds was founded in 2014 but it has grown exponentially in the last year. With the need for solid virtual learning platforms rising, LearnWorlds has been able to meet that supply and demand.

It still remains a private business at the moment, with a small, dedicated group of employees, but perhaps the company will eventually expand, given the positive growth it has seen so far.

Founder and CEO, Panos Siozos, continues to lead the charge, with the headquarters based in Cyprus.

### In their words...

"LearnWorlds is a fast-growing, innovative, e-learning company serving customers in over 100 countries. Founded in mid-2014, we are a passionate company with offices in Greece and Cyprus. LearnWorlds is driven by a highly competitive team, that leads by example, with a strong background in e-learning, innovation, and digital technologies. We design and implement optimal digital learning experiences and help our clients satisfy their students while maximizing their profits."

## Reviews

If you want a little more verification that we know what we're talking about, just listen to these people.

### Some Positives:

"I feel cared for by the amazing support team that knows my name, my work, my problems, and needs. They offered me attention and personalized tips. All that gave a big boost to my online school. If anything could be better than this wonderful software, it's their customer service. Their customer service is the best I ever had in my life." - Teya Bozhilova CEO of I Draw Fashion Ltd.

Likewise...

"LearnWorlds SiteBuilder is so versatile allowing me to create just exactly what I need. They continually reveal new benefits. I also love the convenience of combining my website with my course platform--brilliant! Additionally, LW integrates with Zoom, Active Campaign, and my payment software." - Sue Hurst Career & Life Coach at Deliberate Presence

Positive claims of consistency, support, and active communication really uplift the status of LearnWorlds.

### Some Negatives:

Some people have complained that LearnWorlds takes a bit of time to respond to users' ticket requests. That said, the majority of users are happy with the communication that the help center provides.

LearnWorlds does have some competitors, as does any online platform, but it tends to score well compared to those sites.
