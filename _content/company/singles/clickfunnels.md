## What is¬†ClickFunnels?

ClickFunnels¬†is an online tool for building landing pages and sales funnels. But if you ask their loyal fanbase, they will tell you that it‚Äôs a heck of a lot more than just that.

A better definition would be that Clickfunnels is an all-in-one service for any online entrepreneur who wants to simplify their web page.

Clickfunnels make it easy to build a landing page, get more leads, increase your sales and build your proper brand.

But what's launched Clickfunnels is the concept of sales funnel, which we will discuss now.

Today, we're going to spend a lot of time talking about sales funnels, so it's best to get it out of the way now.

The best way to describe the sales funnel is like in the picture below: a cone flipped upside down that guides the buyer through the process of becoming aware of your business to becoming a customer.

![](/images/click-funnel-1024x548.png)

But what Clickfunnels does, takes it a step further. The cone above guides the buyer to the point where they initially make a sale with your brand. But what happens after that? This is where Clickfunnels can help you.

The sales funnel is a series of online pages that are designed to turn a visitor into a customer and a customer into a repeat customer. It's how a business can get a customer spending $10, to spend $100 in just a couple of clicks.

A sales funnel may include a page for users to give their email address to become a lead, then to a purchase page. After that, a post-purchase sale with one-click upsells and special one-time offers can entice customers to spend more with your brand.

Clickfunnels have helped more than 10,000 people to grow their online business and get more sales. Hundreds of people have built 7 figure businesses using their sales funnel, and a select few have even grown to eight figures!

## Who is Clickfunnels for?

Truthfully, Clickfunnels is for anyone with an online business. It doesn't matter whether you're a mom & pop store trying to squeeze in an extra couple of sales every month or a multimillion-dollar company that wants to take their brand loyalty to the next level.

That‚Äôs what makes it so unique. They are designed for everyone.

The range of features which are incredibly easy to use. It truly makes you feel at ease when you're designing your store just the way you like it.

If you have something to sell and are willing to invest time and resources into designing the best possible web presence, then yes, Clickfunnels can be used for you. In this guide, we're going to show you exactly how you can benefit from it.

## Clickfunnels Features

### Super Easy Drag and Drop Page Builder

Perhaps the number one feature which makes Clickfunnels so easy to use is that it allows people to create beautiful professional-looking landing pages without any coding skills with just a few clicks of a button.

The drag and drop page builder feature allows you to design your landing page the exact way you want.

All you have to do is place elements from the library on the side of the page into the little widgets on the page.

Then‚Ä¶

BOOM: you got your landing page set up. And if you're not fully convinced, just check out this example below.

I'm honest here when I said this; it couldn't get much easier.

![](/images/clickfunnels-features.png)

Another feature that makes Clickfunnels awesome is the number of things that you can put onto your landing page. For example, Clickfunnels has become renowned for one-click upsells & down sells.

![](/images/clickfunnels-upsell-1024x548.png)

This is useful because it will increase the average order value of your sales and increase your profits.

But it doesn't stop there.

Clickfunnels make opt-in forms incredibly easy to put into your website. These opt-in forms allow you to add someone to your email list. They even work with third-party email services like [MailChimp](https://devinschumacher.com/review/mailchimp/) and Aweber.

You can even go as far as creating a member access page where you can provide exclusive content for your customers after they make a purchase. It's simple to use and can make for a great marketing asset.

It can also be split up into different areas and customized for your exact audience.

### A/B Split testing

If you've worked in [digital marketing](https://devinschumacher.com/digital-marketing-for-dummies/) before, you've probably heard this term being thrown around before. But split testing is so important when you're building your online presence.

Put simply, A/B split testing is testing one version of your [landing page against another with slight tweaks or optimizations](https://devinschumacher.com/landing-page-optimization-tools//).

The point is that if everything else remains the same, you can judge whether the improvements have increased or decreased your conversion rate.

This is going to help you prevent wasting time and money on lower-performing elements of your sales funnel. This allows you to quickly find the best landing page layout to boost conversions.

And as we know, higher conversions = higher sales.

### Building Email List and Follow up Funnels

Now, this aspect is where¬†ClickFunnels¬†gets into a league of its own.

Clickfunnels makes it super easy for entrepreneurs to build an email list from scratch.

Clickfunnels enables you to generate an email list without using any third-party tools (but still works seamlessly with many providers).

But it gets better from there. Clickfunnels allows its users to create follow-up funnels to send follow-up sequences to your email list.

How cool is that?

You can send them branded marketing emails with links to a whole new funnel and even create multiple funnels for how warm or cold your audience is to your content.

You‚Äôll have to search long and hard for another landing page builder which offers a tool like this.

### In-Depth Sales Analytics

With Clickfunnels, the advanced sales analytics features mean you'll be able to keep track of all the numbers relating to your sales.

You will get the most important information about the sales of your phones and how well each aspect of your phone is performing.

![](/images/clickfunnels-sales-analytics.png)

The stats include but aren't limited to

¬∑ ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† gross income

¬∑ ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† average order value

¬∑ ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† earning per click

¬∑ ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† conversion rate

All this information is organized to show which aspects of your funnels are performing better or worse than others. This allows you to focus your attention on any holes through which customers might be falling out and how to save them.

### Adding Sub-Users

Clickfunnels makes it super straightforward for somebody to access your Clickfunnels account with various permission settings.

This is extremely useful if you are either very busy or find using [digital marketing](https://devinschumacher.com/digital-marketing-certifications/) intimidating and you want to outsource the work.

You can allow sub-users to access various elements of the Clickfunnels account at any time. You can add multiple sub-users without having to worry about any of your sensitive data getting in the wrong hands.

### Simple Payment Gateways

Clickfunnels users can also benefit from having multiple options for payment processing services.

To collect payments from your customers, you're going to have to integrate with a third-party provider.

You don't need to worry, though, because Clickfunnels has relationships with many payment gateways. The most common ones being:

- PayPal

- Recurly

- Stripe

‚ÄúBut how many payment gateways can I integrate?‚Äù I hear you ask.

Well, it depends on the payment plan you've chosen.

The standard plan means you can have three payment integrations, whereas platinum users can use up to 9 whereas ‚Äò2 comma club‚Äô members can have up to 27 different payment gateways.

But if you‚Äôre just starting, then that shouldn't be an issue for you.

### Many Other Integrations

Oh, and while we're talking about integrations, it's worth mentioning how many other integration Clickfunnels has.

There are many other powerful marketing tools that Clickfunnels allows users to integrate with that are currently available to them. Like the link below shows.

## Cons of Clickfunnels

So, before you think that this is the golden ticket to take your business to the very next level, we will run through some of the drawbacks to using Clickfunnels.

Despite that, overall, Clickfunnels is an exceptionally strong platform to build your online presence; it does have a few areas that need a little bit of work. And this Clickfunnels review wouldn't be complete if we didn't examine those bits as well.

Here are some most common complaints that you will hear of users who use Clickfunnels:

### Too Templated

Too templated is a common complaint that users have with Clickfunnels. Now, this isn't a problem with Clickfunnels itself but more to do with the wider community who use it.

Because Clickfunnels makes it so easy to design and build beautiful landing pages, you end up with many landing pages that look very similar.

When you take into consideration the vast number of users who use Clickfunnels to build their landing page, you get a certain type of landing page that looks very ‚ÄòClickfunnels-like.‚Äô

Make sure to spend some time crafting your landing page the way that you wanted rather than the way that it's laid out in the template. You don‚Äôt want to blend in and fall into this trap.

### Customer Service

Another common complaint of Clickfunnels is the customer service that users receive.

Users will often comment on how slow it takes for customer service to respond to their queries. On top of that, if you ask them anything remotely difficult, particularly about the advanced features of the platform, they won't be very helpful to you.

Personally speaking, I've never had to complain about Clickfunnels or ask them any questions. That's how easy their platform is to use, but users who have used their customer service will complain about this aspect.

As far as direct customer service is concerned, they have a direct chat feature inside the dashboard whenever you log into the member‚Äôs area.

Generally, this is okay for basic questions, but one user remarked that after asking a coding question, it took over three months to reply.

While it is unlikely that you'll need to ask a question of that kind of complexity, it would still be good to know that they have a support team ready to answer your questions.

It documents how when a user noticed that some members were locked out of the memberships area that they had paid for, whereas some non-paying customers had gained access to the member-only content.

When he reached out to customer service, he found that they were unhelpful. Of course, this might be regarded as a ‚Äòfreak accident,‚Äô but it gets the point across.

### Too Simplistic and Overpriced

Perhaps this is the most common complaint that Clickfunnels will receive. There is no doubt that the price is a drawback.

There are two pricing options for Clickfunnels: one that's at $97.00 per month and another at $297.00 per month.

Now, if you're a business that does over 6 figures a year, this might not be a concern. But if you are a small mom-and-pop store that wants to use Clickfunnels, then this might be quite an investment.

This links into another common criticism of Clickfunnels: that it‚Äôs too simple.

However, these criticisms tend to come from website design and digital marketing experts rather than small business owners.

These are the people who truly want to optimize every little detail of their landing page to make it their own. They are prepared to invest heavily to pay attention to smaller details.

To combat this, however, Clickfunnels has introduced coding elements to offer more control to experienced users.

## Clickfunnels Pricing

Like we mentioned earlier, Clickfunnels has 2 different pricing options. Starting at $127.00 a month for 20 sales funnels, Clickfunnels platinum offers $208.00 a month for unlimited funnels.

The main difference between the plans is the number of landing pages that you can create. You can check out the table below, which summarises the main difference between all the pricing plans.

![](/images/clickfunnels-pricing-1024x698.png)

On top of that, there is a ‚Äòtwo comma club‚Äô plan available, but it will set you back more than $2490 per month.

But this plan is only reserved for advanced Clickfunnels users who have generated over 7 figures with their sales funnels and received a special invitation from Clickfunnels to join.

## What is FunnelFlix?

Funnelflix is a large collection of online courses and videos, training modules, and guidance [content to enhance your knowledge of digital marketing](https://devinschumacher.com/what-is-content-marketing/).

It's like the Netflix of online marketing.

¬†If you have access to the Clickfunnels platinum plan, you'll be eligible to watch all the training materials that are made available to you.

There truly is such a massive range of content available for you. From money mindset, copywriting for brick-and-mortar stores, to a Tony Robbins private collection.

If you‚Äôre on the fence about whether you should get the platinum plan or not, this could be enough to persuade you to do so.

## How to Get Started with Clickfunnels

Getting started with Clickfunnels is pretty straightforward. All you have to do is go to clickfunnels.com to begin your 14-day free trial.

The next step to go through is a bit of a pain.

You must create an account by offering them your email, name, and password; then, you have to enter your credit card details \[you won't be charged for 14 days\]. Now you've got two weeks to see if Clickfunnels is right for you and decide for yourself.

Once you log in, you'll find some things lurking around, such as the Clickfunnels dashboard, live support contact, and quick links to some of the most used funnels you have.

From here, you'll be able to navigate yourself around the platform. You can see the menu, your account profile, the backpack feature, and the help menu all in front of you. There‚Äôs not much else you need to know before you get started building your first funnel.

## Final Verdict

So, overall then what's the final verdict for¬†Clickfunnels? Well, we would give it four out of five stars! We genuinely believe that it is, despite the large price tag, one of the best marketing SaaS companies available in the market.

Yes, of course, there are a couple of drawbacks like we have outlined above. If you want a more hands-on solution if you're more of a control freak, then you might want to look into other third-party users that you can link with Clickfunnels.

Like we discussed above, you may get frustrated by the lack of freedom that you can come across or the unhelpful customer support which we've outlined above.

But overall, I don't believe these negative issues outweigh the value of having such a simple and straightforward landing page builder, especially if you are only getting started in an online business.

At the end of the day, Clickfunnels is just a tool. It is a tool to help online businesses increase their conversion rates and make more sales online. On top of that, it can truly guide customers through the buying process and introduce them to your brand.

And overall, it is extremely effective at doing this. Like we have outlined above, the simple drag and drop builder, coupled with the advanced landing page features (such as opt-ins and one-click up/down sells), makes it very easy for many online entrepreneurs to build their online web presence.

Thanks for reading, and we hope you found this guide useful. We wish you all the best in building your next landing page!
