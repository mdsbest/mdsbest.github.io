### Mobile and Asynchronous Learning

Teachable offers students the capability to take your course asynchronously or using mobile technology, vastly improving freedom and creating the ability to learn on the go.

When students can learn anywhere and at any time, there is no limit to their ability to benefit from your course.

You also have the opportunity to schedule synchronous courses. This will allow you to develop a classroom community so that everyone can get to know each other and ask real-time questions.

### Customize Your Site

While Teachable allows you to customize your experience in a multitude of ways, customization is most important when it comes to connecting your students to your content and brand.

Through Teachable, course creators can create a custom domain so that their students can easily see their existing website while also taking advantage of the courses they have to offer.

Not only this but courses themselves can be endlessly customized with multimedia teaching tools so that your teaching and coaching sessions are always engaging. You can use Teachable's page builder to develop your course and track its success without any prior coding knowledge.

The endlessly customizable interface Teachable provides to its users allows you to tailor course content perfectly to your audience.

Comprehensive dashboards allow you to peek at how you're doing on sales and take note of any student insights.

Sales pages offer the opportunity to gauge your course's success at a single glance, allowing you to take the back seat on marketing and refocus your efforts toward other goals. A sales page is also a wonderful way to view all relevant information in one place.

![Screenshot of Teachable's sales page](/images/Teachables-sales-page-973x1024.png)

Teachable also allows you to offer your students advanced pricing options. Through Teachable, you can choose to allow your students the opportunity to subscribe to your lessons, pay for memberships, or bundle together courses.

### Include Your Employees

With Teachable, you have the power to include multiple team members and contributors. Starting with a basic plan, you can have multiple admin-level users; this allows you to grow not only your teaching skills but your small business itself.

### Utilize Top-Notch Teaching Tools

Teachable is ideal for creating multimedia learning environments. Even with just a free plan, you have access to unlimited bandwidth, courses and coaching services, and students for your courses.

On top of engaging course material, you can keep students on track with Calendly integration. This allows your clients to book and schedule their multiple courses with ease.

Finally, keep students motivated through quizzes and course completion certificates. In some cases, a completion certificate can be required for students to move on in order to ensure student transformation.

## Teachable Features

Teachable offers a multitude of advanced features in even our most beginner plan. These features will put you ahead of the rest, allowing your course content and your skills as a teacher or coach to shine through.

### Unlimited Students

Whether you are sharing niche skills or information everyone should learn, you should never be limited on the number of students who are able to enroll in your course.

Limited students mean limited sharing of knowledge and limited ability to profit off of your hard work.

### Instant Payouts 

Instant payouts mean that you never have to wait to get paid for teaching your course content. Course sales will always be transparent, and when you use Teachable Payments, you will be paid once monthly through PayPal for your hard work.

![Screenshot of Teachable Payments](/images/Teachable-Payments-1024x531.png)

### Unlimited Courses

Selling courses is easier when you have the ability to teach as many topics as you wish. With any Teachable plan, you have the power to design any number of courses whether your knowledge base is in knitting or microeconomics.

### Unlimited Coaching Services

Those who use Teachable also have the chance to offer unlimited coaching services.

Sometimes, coaching feels more appropriate than "teaching" - for instance, maybe your brand is more geared towards lifestyle tips and tricks than it is hard skills. Teachable still offers you the capability to teach as much to as many as you wish.

### Product Bundles

Bundling products can increase sales and makes it easier for your students to get access to the information they require.

With any Teachable plan, you can bundle courses or learning tools to allow a perfect, seamless experience for your students

A page builder will allow you to easily build and design your course. Knowledge of coding is not necessary for beautiful and easy-to-use course pages and analytics.

### Product Support

### Basic Quizzes

Teaching becomes much easier when you have the tools to gauge your students' progress at the tips of your fingers. This is why Teachable includes basic quizzes in every plan package.

Quizzes can keep your students engaged and on top of their course material and make it easier for you to track the efficacy of your curriculum.

## Marketing Your Teachable Courses

![Image about Teachable Courses](/images/Teachable-Courses-1024x819.png)

Marketing your Teachable class effectively is the best way to share your skills with a wide audience and boost your business' growth. However, learning how to market and understanding the process of selling online courses is a skill set in and of itself.

While Teachable's sales pages can help you track your existing students, you can boost your sales as well with a little marketing know-how.

Teachable's endless customization capabilities make it easy to create engaging landing pages that will draw in students. Utilize exciting templates to boost course attendance.

Learning some marketing best practices, such as cross-posting your class information to other social media or creating a sales-boosting event or promotion, can truly help you to clinch those new students.

Maintaining existing students becomes a lot easier when you encourage them through in-course marketing such as rewards and certificates.

Boost marketing practices by developing a clear and exciting brand. This brand will exist through all of your media from your copywriting to any images you use.

This will draw in your students and assure them that you are providing the same quality content throughout all of your courses. Teachable makes this easy with simple and beautiful course templates.

After creating your brand, get the word out with email newsletters. Affiliate marketing offered with Teachable's more advanced plans can help you to include sales-boosting links in any newsletter so that your students are always up to date. Making newsletters engaging will also help garner more clients who may have previously been on the fence.

Teachable's blog has an abundance of articles that can help you gain marketing skills and more.

## Working on Teachable: Examples

Teachable courses have no limits when it comes to design and creativity, so they should certainly not be limited in the subject matter.

No matter what your skills are, if you are willing to share them, then Teachable's software could work for you. From the arts to sciences, niche skills, or large-scale academics, you can teach with Teachable.

### Arts

Arts education is often limited in in-person learning scenarios around the world. Therefore, marketing your artistic knowledge on Teachable can be extremely helpful to students who may not get this training elsewhere.

Teachable's most popular art courses are often in subjects such as watercolor painting or figure drawing, but they can also cover more specific topics such as how to use different kinds of drawing software or how to fold paper flowers.

Teachable's endless options for creativity make it the perfect backdrop for a course in the arts.

![Teachable's creativity options](/images/Teachables-creativity-967x1024.png)

### Health

With the rise in popularity of healthy living and exercise, it's no wonder many individuals are turning to online fitness and health classes. Your small business or entrepreneurial spirit can benefit from this by building a course using Teachable.

Some popular health classes on Teachable include training in yoga and even a fitness bootcamp, but you may choose to share your skills in healthy eating or even breastfeeding tips and tricks that you can't find elsewhere.

Offering health classes in an online medium can help to make fitness and healthy eating more accessible to all.

### Niche

You should never feel like your knowledge is too specific or uninteresting. It's more than likely that your Teachable class will be one of a kind and garner a slew of students who are just dying to know what you know.

Topics like shoemaking, bread baking, and even houseplant care have been immensely successful, so there's no reason that your class on tap dance or puppy training wouldn't reach its deserved audience.

There are tons of people who will learn a new skill at any chance they get, so why not share your niche knowledge?

### Academics

Teaching academics through Teachable is a great way to give students extra help or allow them some flexibility with courses that they wouldn't have with in-person schooling.

Creating a Teachable class can be a great way for teachers to get their curriculum to a wider range of students and grow their success as an entrepreneur.

![Class image](/images/class.png)

### Membership

Membership courses on Teachable are those that students pay a subscription for in order to attend multiple courses. This can be a great choice for teachers of subjects that go beyond the scope of just one class.

For example, learning how to play any instrument may take more than just one class, so offering students the opportunity to follow along through a subscription to your courses can be immensely helpful in getting them to the proficiency they desire.

### Business

It's no secret that Teachable is a great resource for businesses of all kinds. Not only can your business utilize Teachable to reach its clients or customers, but it can also create a course to train its employees.

Even courses advertised to the general public can be a great tool for businesses to draw in customers and teach them about their products or services in advance.
