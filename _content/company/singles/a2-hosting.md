## About A2 Hosting

A2 Hosting started in 2001 and was officially launched as a hosting company in 2003. Its name was in honor of Ann Arbor, Michigan, its place of origin. The company started offering shared hosting plans but has grown to offer lots of services, including dedicated server hosting, reseller hosting, and VPS hosting.

They have grown from a two-room office in Ann Arbor to having global employees, data centers, and server locations worldwide. Its mission is to be the best web host solution, and they are staying on that path until it can get there. They are backed with excellent customer service courtesy of their 24/7 guru support team.

## Getting Started with A2 Hosting

Opening the [A2 Hosting](https://serp.ly/a2-hosting) page for the first time is very satisfying. Everything is organized and it is not difficult to find the information you are looking for. Hosting services are arranged perfectly in tabs, and when you open each tab, it redirects to a page that explains the services well, the pricing, features, and more.

To be able to give a more authentic review about A2 Hosting, I signed up for a shared web hosting plan to put it to the test using my website. I chose the StartUp plan for only $2.99 per month but it renews at $10.99 after a year. This plan comes with one website, 100 GB SSD storage, free and easy site migration, a money-back guarantee, unlimited email accounts, and many more.

After I clicked the Get StartUp button, it redirected me to a page for domain registrations. I have to register a new domain name, so I checked if it is still available. Thankfully it is, so I continued with the registration process.

I clicked the continue button, and it redirected me to my shopping cart. I can choose from different billing cycles, and the longer it is, the lower the monthly payment will be. I prefer the three-year plan so that my monthly income is lower.

On this page, I can also upgrade my web hosting account by adding RapidSSL Certificates for $49.99 annually and upgrade to hosting unlimited sites, databases, and email accounts for only $2.00 per month.

I also have the option to choose a server location, add a dedicated IP address for $5.99, or add the A2 Website Builder free for the one-page site, but you have to pay for more than that. I can also auto-install applications like WordPress, Drupal, and many more on my homepage.

Once I was satisfied with my purchase and add-ons, I clicked continue and was redirected to a domain configuration page. I can select to include DNS management free for a year, ID protection at $9.95 per year, and a year of free email forwarding. I added DNS management and email forwarding and clicked continue.

It opened to a review and checkout page. I reviewed everything and then clicked checkout.

I must input my personal information, billing address, domain registration information, account security, and payment details at checkout.

Once done, I clicked the complete order button. I received a welcome message from A2 Hosting sent to my email address right after my payment was confirmed.

## Using and Managing your Website Using A2 Hosting

After you successfully register a hosting account, you can now log in to your customer portal. Use the email address and the password you used in making your account.

The number of tools you can access may be overwhelming for beginners, but you can quickly learn them. You can also access many free cPanel tutorials online.
