# Images Directory

This directory would contain all the images for the website. For a real implementation, you would need to:

1. Add images for blog posts
2. Add a profile image (profile.jpg) for the about page
3. Add any additional images referenced in blog posts

In a real setup, you would copy over images from the original Astro project or replace them with appropriate images for this implementation.
