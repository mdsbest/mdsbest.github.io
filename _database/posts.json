      "content": "<p>When looking to start an e-commerce store, you may be overwhelmed by the number of different e-commerce platforms out there. That&#39;s why it&#39;s important that you not only find the best platform for you but one that is the complete e-commerce solution.</p>\n<p>What that means is finding one that will not only host your website but also help you in the day-to-day operations and management of your store. One that will help you process payments and help with fulfilling orders.</p>\n<p>In this e-commerce battle, we&#39;ve identified two of the biggest e-commerce platforms today: <a href=\"https://serp.ly/bigcommerce/\">BigCommerce</a> and <a href=\"https://serp.ly/shopify/\">Shopify</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p>In this review of BigCommerce vs.Shopify, we&#39;ll compare some of the most notable aspects and see how they stack up against each other. We&#39;ll then choose a winner for each category and provide you with our overall winner at the end.</p>\n<h2>BigCommerce vs.Shopify - An Overview</h2>\n<p>For those unfamiliar with either BigCommerce or Shopify, here is a brief overview of these respective companies.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://serp.ly/bigcommerce/\">BigCommerce</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Was founded in 2009</li>\n<li>Was started in Sydney, Australia by Eddie Machaalani and Mitchell Harper</li>\n<li>Also opened their first American office in 2009 in Austin, Texas</li>\n<li>In 2011, they raised $15 million in a Series A round of funding.</li>\n<li>In 2015, Brett Bellm replaced Machaalani and Harper as CEO.</li>\n<li>In 2016, they partnered with Amazon to provide retailers with inventory syncing capability.</li>\n<li>In 2020, they filed for an IPO and became a public company in August of 2020.</li>\n<li>Serves over 60,000 online stores across 120 countries</li>\n<li>Countries that use BigCommerce the most are the USA, Australia, UK, Brazil, and Canada.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a href=\"https://serp.ly/shopify/\">Shopify</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Was founded in 2006</li>\n<li>Founded by Tobias Lütke and Scott Lake</li>\n<li>Origins of the company started in Ottawa, Canada.</li>\n<li>In 2013, launched Shopify Payments</li>\n<li>In 2015, they filed for an IPO and became a public company in May 2015.</li>\n<li>In 2017, they secured a key integration with Amazon.</li>\n<li>As of 2020, there are over 7,000 employees worldwide.</li>\n<li>In 2020, they announced the Alipay partnership for cross-border payments.</li>\n<li>As of May 2021, it has more than 1.7 million online stores across 175 countries.</li>\n<li>Generated $2.93 billion in revenue in 2020</li>\n<li>Countries that use Shopify the most are the USA, UK, and Australia.</li>\n<li>25% of revenues come from the Shopify Plus pricing plan</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>User Experience And Overall Ease Of Use</h2>\n<p>One of the challenges with any tech platform is making it widely accessible while also making it easy to use. This is because not everyone is tech-savvy as some users can be vastly more experienced or less experienced than others.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, BigCommerce and Shopify tend to both do well in ensuring that their platforms are relatively easy to use for everyone. On the whole, the interface for both platforms is intuitive and for areas that are perhaps more nuanced, they offer a short explanation.</p>\n<p>Users that have experience with other content management systems (CMS), such as WordPress, will likely have a smoother user experience when using either platform.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://serp.ly/bigcommerce/\">BigCommerce</a></h3>\n<p>BigCommerce offers a good blend of colors and things are generally easy to find with their dashboard. Like many other CMS platforms, BigCommerce uses a column on the left side as the main navigation area. To the right of the navigation is where the main content will be displayed from clicking any one of the links in the navigation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://serp.ly/shopify/\">Shopify</a></h3>\n<p>Shopify also charges zero transaction fees...but there&#39;s a catch. You will only be charged zero dollars if you use Shopify Payments. The Shopify Payments system is Shopify&#39;s own internal payment gateway that they use to process credit card transactions.</p>\n<p>The one downfall to using Shopify Payments is that it is not available for use in all countries. While it is available for use in most developed countries, there also are some exceptions. One of them being that Shopify Payments is available in the USA but not in any American territories. Thus, if you were using Shopify in Guam, you would not be eligible to use Shopify Payments.</p>\n<p>However, not all Shopify users are forced to use Shopify Payments. In fact, you don&#39;t have to at all. Just know that if you opt not to use it, you will be charged transaction fees. The percentage you will be charged is dependent on the type of pricing plan you&#39;re on with Shopify.</p>\n<p>As for credit card fees, if you&#39;re using Shopify Payments, the fees you incur will depend on the Shopify pricing plan you&#39;re on. Take a look at the graphic below and you will see the percentage and fixed fee you will be charged by each Shopify plan.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<h3>The Victor: BigCommerce</h3>\n<p>BigCommerce is the big winner here simply because their no transaction fees come with no strings attached. You&#39;re not required to be on any type of plan with BigCommerce and offers users more flexibility.</p>\n<p>On top of that, their credit card fees, when partnered up with PayPal, are slightly cheaper than the credit card fees attached to Shopify Payments.</p>\n<h2>Customer Support</h2>\n<p>Customer support is a critical feature to have for platforms where, with one simple click of your mouse, something can easily go wrong. The level of customer support can vary between different companies and so for e-commerce stores, you&#39;ll want to find a platform where customer support is excellent. We can easily say that BigCommerce and Shopify offer top-notch customer support for their users.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://serp.ly/bigcommerce/\">BigCommerce</a></h3>\n<p>The BigCommerce customer support prides itself on 24/7 customer support whether that&#39;s through the phone or via live chat. After all, they service customers around the world and it&#39;s only fair that customers in all regions are serviced if they need assistance.</p>\n<p>While the 24/7 support is great, BigCommerce takes it a step further with its <a href=\"https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/?language=en_US\">Help Center</a> page. This page is for users that may just want to poke around and see if they can find the answers to their issues instead of seeking out a live customer support agent.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/bigcommerce-vs-shopify-image-1743439914855.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/bigcommerce-vs-shopify-image-1743439914855.jpg\"></p>\n<p>This page can best be described as a BigCommerce community of users all looking to help each other while getting access to the resources they need. Users will find different modules that will help them find the answers they want and learn more about how they can best leverage the BigCommerce platform.</p>\n<p>They have a &quot;Trending Now&quot; section that shows users what the most popular groups are, the most recent questions asked, and recent news and updates. Overall, it&#39;s a great community support system and another excellent resource for BigCommerce users to have access to on top of their already stellar 24/7 customer support.</p>\n<p>Though it&#39;s not customer support, when new users sign up to use the platform, a BigCommerce sales agent will give you a quick, 10-minute call. This call is intended to welcome you to the e-commerce platform and to also get an idea of what your business goals are. It&#39;s a nice onboarding gesture that helps make new users feel welcome.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://serp.ly/shopify/\">Shopify</a></h3>\n<p>To the surprise of no one, Shopify also offers 24/7 customer support via phone and live chat.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/bigcommerce-vs-shopify-image-1743439915470.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/bigcommerce-vs-shopify-image-1743439915470.jpg\"></p>\n<p>If users prefer not to contact a live customer agent, they can also turn to the <a href=\"https://help.shopify.com/en\">Shopify Help Center</a> page. This page is similar to the one that BigCommerce with the exception being that the Shopify page does not include community members.</p>\n<p>In fact, it&#39;s just a simple page where you find the category your issue may fall under and hope that your answer is there. We say &quot;hope&quot; that your answer is there because this Help Center is not very robust at all and may not tackle some of the technical issues users may have.</p>\n<p>We should note that Shopify has a community page, but it is not connected to their Help page.</p>\n<h3>The Victor: BigCommerce</h3>\n<p>When it comes down to BigCommerce vs.Shopify&#39;s customer support, the clear-cut winner is BigCommerce. First, they take the time, even if it&#39;s just 10 minutes, to get to know you and what your goals are with your e-commerce store. This is something that Shopify does not do.</p>\n<p>Second, their help page is a significant step above Shopify&#39;s because they include their community on this page. Engaging the BigCommerce community makes it a platform for everyone and users are able to see the questions and issues some users are having. If they are unable to resolve their issue on this page, other BigCommerce users can step in and help answer questions for them if they know it.</p>\n<p>Both BigCommerce and Shopify are great with their live customer support that is available 24/7. However, BigCommerce&#39;s community-building aspect on their help page is what seals the deal for us.</p>\n<h2>Pricing</h2>\n<p>As many shoppers know, the final decision can often come down to pricing. After all, people want a good deal and don&#39;t want to overpay on something where the value may not be there.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, both BigCommerce and Shopify have plenty of excellent features and offer great value for your online store. As you&#39;ll see, the pricing of both platforms is identical. However, there are some minor differences between the two.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://serp.ly/bigcommerce/\">BigCommerce</a></h3>\n<p>BigCommerce pricing gives users a choice to pay either monthly or annually. When paying annually, users of the Plus and Pro plans can expect to receive a 10% discount on their plans. A 15-day free trial is also offered for people who aren&#39;t sold on a paid plan yet.</p>\n<p>Here are the BigCommerce pricing plans on a monthly basis.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/bigcommerce-vs-shopify-image-1743439916143.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/bigcommerce-vs-shopify-image-1743439916143.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Here are the BigCommerce pricing plans on an annual basis.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/bigcommerce-vs-shopify-image-1743439916790.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/bigcommerce-vs-shopify-image-1743439916790.jpg\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://serp.ly/bigcommerce/\">Click here to check BigCommerce&#39;s pricing &amp; current deals</a>.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://serp.ly/shopify/\">Shopify</a></h3>\n<p>Shopify features three paid plans that are only offered on a monthly payment cadence. The least expensive is the Basic Shopify plan which is $29 per month while for $299 per month you can get the Advanced Shopify plan.</p>\n<p>On top of this, you are also entitled to a 14-day free trial that does not require you to enter your credit card!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/bigcommerce-vs-shopify-image-1743439917483.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/bigcommerce-vs-shopify-image-1743439917483.jpg\"></p>\n<p><strong>Shopify Plus</strong></p>\n<p>Shopify Plus is an enterprise plan that is primarily exclusive to online stores that generate a ton of volume and sales revenue. It offers users much more flexibility in terms of the apps that are available to them, customer support, and more.</p>\n<p>Its pricing is different from the regular plans in that you are charged on a sliding scale which can range from $2,000 to $40,000 per month. This range is very wide because it is dependent on how many resources and the bandwidth your online store uses.</p>\n<p><strong>Shopify Lite</strong></p>\n<p>Shopify Lite is a watered-down version of Shopify&#39;s offerings where you can use some of Shopify&#39;s features but you can&#39;t build your online store with it. This plan is intended for people who want to sell their products in person but don&#39;t want to use all the features in a regular Shopify plan. If you already have an existing e-commerce store, you can also purchase the Shopify Lite plan to add a buy button to your website.</p>\n<p>Shopify Lite will only cost you $9 per month.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://serp.ly/shopify/\">Click here to check Shopify&#39;s pricing &amp; current deals.</a></p>\n<h3>The Victor: Shopify</h3>\n<p>It&#39;s tough to pick a winner in the BigCommerce vs.Shopify pricing debate since both of their paid plans are identical. However, the features offered in Shopify outweigh the features you get in BigCommerce and even offset the 10% discount you receive on annual plans in BigCommerce.</p>\n<p>Shopify&#39;s pricing is also more flexible than BigCommerce. They have plans for users that want to use some (but not all) of their features and for users that already do massive amounts of volume and sales revenue per month.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Shopify is the clearcut winner in the pricing debate.</p>\n<h2>What Are The Pros And Cons Of BigCommerce?</h2>\n<p>Like any e-commerce platform, BigCommerce has its pros and cons.</p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>No transaction fees for online merchants</li>\n<li>Low credit card fees but only when partnered up with their preferred vendor, PayPal</li>\n<li>Good selection of third-party apps to integrate with</li>\n<li>Terrific selection of free templates to help you get started</li>\n<li>Easy to find design themes based on your store&#39;s category or niche</li>\n<li>Excellent reporting with the Ecommerce Insights package</li>\n<li>The drag-and-drop editing feature is easy and time-saving for beginners.</li>\n<li>Excellent customer support and community-building aspect when looking for BigCommerce help</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ecommerce Insights reporting can be expensive depending on your BigCommerce plan.</li>\n<li>Third-party theme offering is not as plentiful as Shopify&#39;s.</li>\n<li>The dashboard can be overwhelming to use for beginners to content management systems (CMS).</li>\n<li>Does not have its own POS system</li>\n<li>Heavy reliance on third-party applications to get the most out of BigCommerce</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What Are The Pros And Cons Of Shopify?</h2>\n<p>Here are the key pros and cons of using Shopify.</p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Has a very clean and intuitive interface and dashboard</li>\n<li>Offers a great variety of flexible pricing plans</li>\n<li>Shopify Payments is a groundbreaking way for users to control the entire sales process inside of Shopify.</li>\n<li>Good variety of free and paid design themes</li>\n<li>Has a vast community of third-party applications and themes that Shopify users can purchase and use</li>\n<li>Superior marketing and sales functionality from its mobile app</li>\n<li>Good 24/7 customer support</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>High transaction fees unless you opt to use Shopify Payments</li>\n<li>High credit card fees</li>\n<li>Switching templates can cause formatting issues to your site.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>BigCommerce vs.Shopify: And the Winner is...</h2>\n<p>While both <a href=\"https://serp.ly/bigcommerce/\">BigCommerce</a> and <a href=\"https://serp.ly/shopify/\">Shopify</a> have plenty of features to help online business owners sell their products, we think Shopify is the overwhelming winner in this battle of BigCommerce vs.Shopify.</p>\n<p>Shopify is simply a much more polished platform between the two. In terms of e-commerce solutions, Shopify is probably among, if not the best in the market today.</p>\n<p>Their platform and dashboard are easy and intuitive to use and they offer a good selection of free themes to get you started. Since it&#39;s such a widely used e-commerce platform, there are many themes you can also find on third-party websites.</p>\n<p>Lastly, when it comes to payment, Shopify makes the experience seamless by offering their Shopify Payments. This path provides merchants with a singular way to process sales, check inventory, and ring up sales, all from our POS system.</p>\n"

      "content": "<p>When it comes to choosing an editing tool, Canva and PicMonkey are probably at the top of your list.</p>\n<p>They have launched almost at the same time a few years ago and became extremely popular and functional since.</p>\n<p>They can both magically turn you into a graphic designer without having to download any kind of software or go through a whole bunch of annoying tutorials. </p>\n<p>Even if you have no idea what you’re doing!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p>They make perfect allies for influencers, small business owners, or anyone who needs professional-looking results but lacks the time and experience. </p>\n<p>Both tools can successfully achieve similar results and they are constantly adding features that kind of match the ones that the other platform has.</p>\n<h2>Differences Between Canva And PicMonkey</h2>\n<p>Even though they are similar, they serve slightly different purposes. </p>\n<p>The first thing you’ll notice about <a href=\"https://serp.ly/picmonkey/\">PicMonkey</a> is that its photo editor is way superior to Canva’s, although Canva has more and better design tools. </p>\n<p>PicMonkey is aimed at everyday photo-editing. It covers all your basic edits plus filters and overlays, including a few special tricks specially designed for correcting or enhancing photos of people. </p>\n<p>You can also read our full <a href=\"https://devinschumacher.com/review/picmonkey/\">review on PicMonkey here</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://serp.ly/canva/\">Canva</a>, on the other hand, focuses on producing graphics that are suitable for a range of digital and print applications. You can create images for social media and blogs, infographics, special document layouts, letterheads, business cards, posters, etc. </p>\n<p>Tough choice here, I know. It will depend on what’s more important to you. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://devinschumacher.com/review/canva//\">Check out our full review on Canva here.</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Let’s dive into the details. We will analyze and compare four different aspects of these tools so that you can choose the one that suits your needs better. </p>\n<h3>The Photo Editor</h3>\n<p>Most users will agree that PicMonkey seems to be the clear winner here. </p>\n<p>Both interfaces are similar. Editing features are located on the left side, and there’s a top bar with other options like sharing, downloading, and resizing the design. They are both clean, straightforward, and user-friendly. </p>\n<p>PicMonkey’s might be a bit harder to use, but that’s only because its functionalities are more complex. </p>\n<p>Its photo editing tools are quite sophisticated without being too technical, but you still have to understand what you’re doing. It definitely takes a while to get the hang of it. </p>\n<p>Luckily, PicMonkey offers several tutorials to help you achieve your desired results. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Okay, but what about Canva? </p>\n<p>Well, it is true that Canva’s photo editor is rather limited and only offers the basic adjustments. </p>\n<p>But at least it’s free! </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Canva’s got your back and deserves some credit for that as well.</p>\n<p>You can easily do a quick edit without having to start a free trial or commit in any way. No payments, no watermarks.  </p>\n<p>Besides, PicMonkey’s editor is a bit slower and lags sometimes, which can be pretty annoying. Canva also allows you to design multiple pieces on a single page, whereas you must start a new page for each design on PicMonkey. </p>\n<p>This proves that even though PicMonkey’s photo editor is superior, Canva seems to be more practical, and offers smarter solutions. </p>\n<h3>The Apps and Integrations</h3>\n<p>One single tool is never good enough, that’s what integrations are for. They are third-party tools that come in handy when the main platform could use a little support. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p>PicMonkey features some useful integrations like social media apps and Google Drive. Given the nature of this tool, I would say that is the bare minimum. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p>But Canva did quite an impressive job here. It integrates with pretty much every app you can possibly need. You can go ahead and explore their app directory, but here’s a little summary: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Storage services such as Dropbox. </li>\n<li>Social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn.</li>\n<li>Email marketing tools like Mailchimp</li>\n<li>Editing extensions (see “Enhance Your Images” section in their directory).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And the list goes on and on. </p>\n<h3>The Features</h3>\n<p>When looking for an editing tool, the features are the first thing you need to analyze. Does this tool offer what you’re looking for? Does it suit your needs? If it doesn’t, there’s no reason to consider it. It is just not gonna be worth the investment. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Canva and PicMonkey offer pretty much the same features. You will, in fact, be able to achieve similar results using both tools. </p>\n<p>However, you may need features that are only present in either one or the other. It’s on you to decide which ones you appreciate the most. </p>\n<h4>Features Canva Has But PicMonkey Doesn’t</h4>\n<p><strong>Instant Animation</strong></p>\n<p>Canva allows you to animate your designs in one click. You can then download your creation as a GIF or video. You can make your visuals pop, slide, fade, and more. </p>\n<p>There are 14 different animation styles. Curious? Check out this video tutorial. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzujeQtUAbs\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzujeQtUAbs</a></p>\n<p><strong>Content Planner</strong></p>\n<p>This one is a must for influencers and social media entrepreneurs. You can schedule your designs to be posted on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Twitter, among other platforms. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Select a design or create a new one, and assign a day and time. Canva will take it from there. This will save you a lot of time!</p>\n<p><strong>Canva Print</strong></p>\n<p>We all have to admit this is genius. Now you can not only create designs but also have them printed and delivered to your doorstep in one click. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Birthday invitations, flyers, posters, and even T-shirts. You can bring any creation to life. According to them, their prints are top quality and sustainable.</p>\n<p>They even offer free delivery! </p>\n<h4>Features PicMonkey Has But Canva Doesn’t</h4>\n<p><strong>Full-featured Photo Editing</strong></p>\n<p>As we’ve seen earlier in the article, this is the main difference between both tools. </p>\n<p>PicMonkey offers features like cosmetic touch-ups (skin smoother, teeth whitening, lip tint, etc.) </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Then you also have advanced options like dodge and burn, levels, curves, and color changer. </p>\n<p>Let’s not forget the filters here. PicMonkey has a neverending selection of effects and textures that you can apply to the whole photo or to some sections, with a special brush. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p>PicMonkey’s photo editor is basically Photoshop for dummies. Of course, it can’t replace a professional editing tool but it is pretty decent and requires zero experience. </p>\n<p><strong>Simultaneous Co-Editing</strong></p>\n<p>Even though Canva allows you to share a design and have others edit it as a team, you can’t do it at the same time. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p>With PicMonkey you can work together with other people simultaneously. Multiple team members can create together on the same files, at the same time, from different places. </p>\n<p>This can be a game-changer if you need to cooperate with others on a project. It makes teamwork much more effective, as you don’t have to wait until the other person is done making their edits to intervene. </p>\n<h3>The Pricing</h3>\n<p>The first thing to consider here is that <a href=\"https://serp.ly/canva\">Canva</a> has a pretty functional free version that requires no financial commitment of any kind, while <a href=\"https://serp.ly/picmonkey\">PicMonkey</a> only offers a 7-day trial period or a free mobile app. </p>\n<p>So if you’re not willing to invest money in an editing tool, you will have to stick to Canva’s free version or start looking for alternatives. </p>\n<p>Now, which one is more convenient?</p>\n<p>They both offer 3 similar plans. </p>\n<p>Canva’s first plan is the free version of this tool. This comes in handy for people who are not ready to commit or who only need to make a spontaneous design every now and then. </p>\n<p>PicMonkey’s Basic plan is the cheapest, at $7.99 monthly or $72 annually. If we’re being honest here, no one goes for the basic. The Pro subscription is way superior, without being that much more expensive. </p>\n<p>Needless to say, PicMonkey’s Basic subscription can’t possibly compete against Canva’s 100% free version. </p>\n<p>But Canva also has a Pro plan, with pretty much the same features as PicMonkey’s. And what’s more, for the exact same price. Both subscriptions are $12.99 monthly and $119.99 annually. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Last but not least, the Business plan. </p>\n<p>PicMonkey’s Team plan works as a package for 3 or more users. It costs $33.99 monthly ($11.33 per user) and $300 annually. </p>\n<p>Canva’s Enterprise subscription costs $30 per person per month, although the price changes depending on how many users you need. </p>\n<p>Another thing to consider is that Canva offers a 30-day free trial period while PicMonkey only lets you try its paid plans for a week. </p>\n<p>If you base your decision solely on the price, I’d say Canva Pro is better for individuals while PicMonkey Team seems to be the best option for companies or small businesses. </p>\n<h2>Pros &amp; Cons: Canva vs.PicMonkey</h2>\n<h3>Canva</h3>\n<p><strong>What I like</strong> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>It has a jaw-dropping template library with thousands of incredible options. You certainly won’t be disappointed. </li>\n<li>Extremely user-friendly drag-and-drop editor. This tool is beyond intuitive. The first time you use it feels like you’ve been using it for years. </li>\n<li>Easy to ass and layer photos and other elements. No need to struggle with the size and format.  </li>\n<li>Super responsive. You can add and make instant changes. No glitching, no waiting a few seconds. Canva is fast and effective. </li>\n<li>It suggests color palettes based on the elements in your design. You can choose whatever palette you want and it will be automatically applied to your project.</li>\n<li>The free version is perfect for individuals or spontaneous projects. You can perfectly make good use of this tool without paying a cent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What I don’t like</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Poor photo editor. It only includes essential features like cropping, adding filters, and adjusting brightness, contrast, and tint. The basics. </li>\n<li>Sometimes it’s hard to do things like resizing an element without messing up the whole design. This is solved by learning how to group and layer elements in the correct way, but it’s still kind of tricky. </li>\n<li>Many of the coolest features are only available for paid subscribers. A good example of this is the background remover, which is a must if you need to work on a logo.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>  </p>\n<h3>PicMonkey</h3>\n<p><strong>What I like</strong> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>When it comes to editing pictures, Picmonkey is the clear winner. Its editor is much more sophisticated. It features more and better functionalities. </li>\n<li>You can add your own fonts.</li>\n<li>Great selection of stock images.</li>\n<li>Picmonkey&#39;s color choosing tool is more sophisticated. It lets you introduce a hex code for the specific color you want or select the color from the elements in your design.</li>\n<li>It allows you to check the dimensions of all elements separately and resize them.</li>\n<li>It has a draw function. You can use an auto-smoothing brush to trace lines around the elements that you want to highlight.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What I don’t like</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Picmonkey&#39;s drag and drop editor is not very smart. You have to struggle with it to get the image in the right place and size, like when you want to include a picture in a Word doc and it messes up everything around it.</li>\n<li>Picmonkey is a bit slower. If you type quickly it might miss some characters. Plus, there&#39;s a little bit of a click delay.</li>\n<li>It offers a free trial, but you will eventually have to pay. There is no free desktop version. </li>\n<li>It is not as user-friendly as its competitors. It might take you a while to really get the hang of it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<h3>Choose Canva If…</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You need to create cool graphics, social media posts, work presentations, and other visuals. </li>\n<li>You’re not willing to invest money in an editing tool. </li>\n<li>You want to have your creations printed and sent to you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://serp.ly/canva\">Click here to check out Canva for free.</a></p>\n<h3>Choose PicMonkey If…</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You want to edit and enhance photos but don’t have access to professional software. </li>\n<li>You need to work on a project as a team.</li>\n<li>You like to make edits on the go and need a mobile version.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There is no right answer here. Hopefully, this analysis helped you decide what would work best for you. </p>\n<p>There’s no need to settle for one or the other, though.</p>\n<p>Most people like to use them in tandem because they make great complements. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://serp.ly/picmonkey\">Click here to check out PicMonkey for free.</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n"

      "content": "<p>In 2015, over 70% of businesses multiplied their content output tenfold.</p>\n<p>The global economy keeps growing, and the need for graphic design services has been increasing ever since, with the entire industry valued at a whopping $15 billion.</p>\n<p>This number is only going to go upward. With most businesses scrambling to embrace a virtual persona to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, demand has been higher than ever.</p>\n<p>Frustratingly, though, it’s not feasible for most businesses to outsource digital agencies or hire freelance graphic designers.</p>\n<p>If you want to cut down on costs and learn their work yourself, you can – but for the 90% of the world’s creative professionals who use Adobe Photoshop, the journey to proficient graphic designership is a slightly steep learning curve. The license is pretty expensive, too.</p>\n<p>Enter <a href=\"https://serp.ly/canva\">Canva</a>. Or Crello. They’re both great. But what are they?

It works on a freemium model that has experienced designers and newbies alike flocking to use it.</p>\n<p>Canva is very easy to navigate, and even its free version offers a wide variety of templates that you can put to good use. Its drag-and-drop interface will have you churning out designs in a matter of minutes and, with a little bit of practice, your content will have an aesthetic, professional designer feel to it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://serp.ly/canva\">Snag your quote here for Canva.</a></p>\n<h2>What Is Crello?</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/crello-vs-canva-image-1743439922336.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/crello-vs-canva-image-1743439922336.jpg\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://devinschumacher.com/review/crello\">Crello</a> is the new kid on the block. Launched in 2018, it has over two million users worldwide and is responsible for over 3000 designs every day. It may seem like a measly number in front of Canva’s 400 million designs to date (and counting), but don’t be fooled.</p>\n<p>Crello and Canva share many of the same features and both have an intuitive interface that makes the user experience pleasing and extremely easy to use. In addition, Crello boasts a library of over 100 million high-quality images on top of 500,000 premium free photos.</p>\n<p>It’s a fair bit cheaper, too, so it may be a more attractive option to those just starting.</p>\n<h2>Pricing</h2>\n<h3><a href=\"https://serp.ly/canva/\">Canva</a></h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/crello-vs-canva-image-1743439922415.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/crello-vs-canva-image-1743439922415.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Canva has a free plan Canva Free, which is good enough for most people’s needs. In addition, it has about 50,000 graphic design templates which will allow you to create designs for most of your needs and is probably the most thing for new designers who are just starting.</p>\n<p>However, if you’re looking to bump up to Canva Pro, which costs $12.99 per month, you’ll upgrade to a whole bunch of new premium features (which we’ll talk about a bit later).</p>\n<p>If that’s not enough for you, Canva Enterprise is available for $30 a month with the whole package of design tools and third-party integrations.</p>\n<h3>Crello</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/crello-vs-canva-image-1743439923149.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/crello-vs-canva-image-1743439923149.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Crello’s monthly pricing comes in at $7.99 per month. So it’s definitely cheaper, but while both Crello and Canva share many of the same design elements, Crello only has 25,000 design templates to choose from.</p>\n<p>Of course, this is plenty to work with 25,000 free templates are no joke, but Canva lets you choose from double that amount, and having options is always a good thing.</p>\n<p>It’s worth keeping in mind that Canva offers a 7-day free trial, so you can try Canva Pro out before deciding whether you want to upgrade. Crello also entertains a free trial for its Pro version, which is new.</p>\n<p>Crello offers no such “Enterprise” plan, either. So, while both online graphic design tools offer powerful free plans and provide very similar features, Canva slightly edges it for us, even if it’s a little bit pricier.</p>\n<p>While you may feel the Canva Enterprise’s price might make a significant difference to your wallet, Canva Pro’s $12.99 price tag lets you create stunning designs that are well worth the cost.</p>\n<h2>Who Is It For?</h2>\n<h3><a href=\"https://serp.ly/canva/\">Canva</a></h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/crello-vs-canva-image-1743439923187.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/crello-vs-canva-image-1743439923187.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Canva is an extremely versatile online tool that can be used by bloggers, small business owners, students, teachers – anybody, really. The list goes on.</p>\n<p>Whether you need it to make a presentation for a class, or if you’re a freelancer using it for a part-time gig, Canva offers a wide array of features that suit everyone – free plan, Canva Pro, or Canva Enterprise.</p>\n<p>In fact, some Fortune 500 companies are known to use Canva templates for their graphic designs. </p>\n<p>As a result, social media managers’ lives have been made much easier and the best part is if you don’t have a social media manager, you can be your own. That’s the beauty of new-age online graphic design software.</p>\n<h3>Crello</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/crello-vs-canva-image-1743439923217.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/crello-vs-canva-image-1743439923217.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Whether you opt for the free Crello plan or Crello Pro, Canva and Crello appeal to much of the same demographic and are used at various levels through the business – and design – hierarchy.</p>\n<p>Crello offers attractive plans to create stunning graphics if you are really tight on a budget.</p>\n<p>Its user interface isn’t any more complicated than Canva’s, and with a little practice, the visual content you put out will be entirely up to you, regardless of who you are and which design tool you choose to use.</p>\n<p>If you’re happy with the 25,000 Crello templates and you don’t mind the free version, then even the lowest-tier option here can yield great results. It’s plenty powerful anyway.</p>\n<h2>Features: Canva Vs Crello (Free Plans)</h2>\n<p>Firstly, let’s get into what Canva and Crello offer in terms of their Free and Pro plans, and then we’ll dive a little deeper from there.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/crello-vs-canva-image-1743439923243.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/crello-vs-canva-image-1743439923243.jpg\"></p>\n<h3>Photos</h3>\n<h4>Canva</h4>\n<p>To start off with, you get over 200,000+ free images with Canva to use for your photo editing and social media graphics. There are quite a few handy editing options in the image converter as well.</p>\n<p>Premium images (of which 75 million and above) will cost you $1 a pop if you don’t have the Pro plan.</p>\n<h4>Crello</h4>\n<p>Crello gives you access to a huge library of 650k free stock images that you can use in your image editing and graphic designs.</p>\n<p>Crello’s parent company, Depositphotos, blows Canva out of the water with its premium image library of over 180 million stock images if you have the Pro plan. An image here is $0.99 apiece if you don’t have a Pro account.</p>\n<h3>Videos</h3>\n<h4>Canva</h4>\n<p>Canva gives you a collection of 13,000 free videos on the Free plan. They’re high-quality stock videos that cover a wide variety of themes.</p>\n<h4>Crello</h4>\n<p>Crello more than doubles Canva’s video library, with a vast collection of 32,000 videos. All for free.</p>\n<h3>Templates</h3>\n<h4>Canva</h4>\n<p>Creating designs is really easy with Canva due to its numerous readymade template categories. You can create graphics for your social media platforms with the 250,000+ saved templates available. It’s amazing how much you get with a free account.</p>\n<h4>Crello</h4>\n<p>Although the design element isn’t necessarily lacking, Crello does fall slightly short with only 30,000 free templates.</p>\n<p>There’s more than enough to work your way through with, but a few more options would have been nice.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/crello-vs-canva-image-1743439923274.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/crello-vs-canva-image-1743439923274.jpg\"></p>\n<h3>Animation Styles</h3>\n<h4>Canva</h4>\n<p>If you’re into video editing, Canva’s neat array of animations with graphic elements lets you bolster your designs through its six different animation styles.</p>\n<p>The ever-so-simple drag-and-drop editor lets you add motion and movement to different design elements which take simple designs and makes them stunning designs.</p>\n<h4>Crello</h4>\n<p>Video editing can be done with Crello too, albeit you’ll have two fewer animation styles to choose from (four).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/crello-vs-canva-image-1743439923403.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/crello-vs-canva-image-1743439923403.jpg\"></p>\n<h3>Fonts</h3>\n<h4>Canva</h4>\n<p>Canva’s free plan has more fonts than you’ll ever need.</p>\n<p>However, if you have any of your own fonts that you want to upload, you’ll have to do that by adding custom fonts to the Brand Kit option via a Pro subscription.</p>\n<h4>Crello</h4>\n<p>Crello has no such limitations when it comes to fonts.</p>\n<p>Even on the Free plan, you can upload your own custom fonts without paying a single penny.</p>\n<h3>Resizing</h3>\n<h4>Canva</h4>\n<p>Alas, if you want to resize designs, you’ll need a Canva Pro account.</p>\n<p>However, a quick little hack you can use is to open up a new design in the dimensions you want, and then copy the design elements from your original design to your new tab.</p>\n<p>You’ll have to organize each design element as per your preferred arrangement, but that’s one way to work around it if you aren’t willing to go Pro.</p>\n<h4>Crello</h4>\n<p>Crello strikes again!</p>\n<p>It doesn’t matter what format you’re working on, or if you’re even working through the mobile app – yes, these lovely design tools have mobile versions – because you can easily resize designs to your liking with Crello’s free plan.</p>\n<h3>Transparent Backgrounds</h3>\n<h4>Canva</h4>\n<p>If you have your own logo or personal branding of any sort, this tool will come in handy.</p>\n<p>Sadly, this is yet another Canva Pro feature that lets you download a PNG of any element you want with a transparent background.</p>\n<h4>Crello</h4>\n<p>Crello does allow you to download images off its Free version with a transparent background however, there’s a catch.</p>\n<p>You can only use it on designs that have a white background. Otherwise, you’ll have to go for Crello Pro.</p>\n<h3>Storage</h3>\n<h4>Canva</h4>\n<p>A free account on Canva gives you access to 5 GB of cloud storage for all your content.</p>\n<h4>Crello</h4>\n<p>The exact limit on Crello’s free plan is unknown, but there is a storage limit.</p>\n<p>You’ll need the Pro plans for Canva and Crello if you want at least 100 GB of storage, if not unlimited storage.</p>\n<h3>Folders</h3>\n<h4>Canva</h4>\n<p>With Canva Free, you can create up to two folders to organize your work.</p>\n<h4>Crello</h4>\n<p>Crello allows you to create as many folders as you want to help you keep your designs organized.</p>\n<p>It is convenient if you need to work with social media designs and need designs of different dimensions for different social media platforms.</p>\n<h3>Downloads</h3>\n<h4>Canva</h4>\n<p>Arguably, one of Canva’s most attractive features is the ability to have unlimited downloads.</p>\n<p>You can download as many designs as you like with a free Canva account, no matter the format.</p>\n<h4>Crello</h4>\n<p>Unfortunately, this feature is a real let-off for some people when it comes to Crello.</p>\n<p>Crello and Canva have both been fairly matched until now when it comes to the free Crello vs.Canva battle.</p>\n<p>However, the fact that you can only download five free designs per month is slightly disappointing.</p>\n<h3>Teams And Collaboration</h3>\n<h4>Canva</h4>\n<p>The team collaboration option is a standout feature of Canva. It really is quite superb.</p>\n<p>Even with the freebie, you can create up to 20 teams and – get this – have 3000 members per team.</p>\n<p>You can even assign roles if you have a social media team, like an Administrator or a Member, and invite team members to view or edit designs.</p>\n<p>You and your team members can even leave comments on designs in and you can tag each other to let each other know if you have any feedback on ongoing designs.</p>\n<h4>Crello</h4>\n<p>If you want team collaboration for social media or any other work that you might have, the Canva vs.Crello debate could end for you here.</p>\n<p>Crello doesn’t offer any team collaborations or team management without its Pro version, and even then, you’re limited to just 10 members per team.</p>\n<h3>Mobile Applications</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/crello-vs-canva-image-1743439923417.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/crello-vs-canva-image-1743439923417.jpg\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/crello-vs-canva-image-1743439923428.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/crello-vs-canva-image-1743439923428.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Fear not, for you won’t have to download shady third-party apps to make designs if you’re on the go.</p>\n<p>Canva and Crello both have their own proprietary smartphone apps which you can find on your operating system of choice.</p>\n<p>They’re both clean, intuitive interfaces on mobile and you should get by perfectly fine if you need to make a few minimal tweaks here and there.</p>\n<h3>Customer Support</h3>\n<p>Both tools offer chat-based support if you need to get around any minor inconveniences while using either software.</p>\n<p>However, if you need some extra help, the customer support team for both companies is superb, although Crello seems to get back to you a tad quicker if you’re running a tight deadline on design submissions.</p>\n<h2>Features: Canva Vs Crello (Pro Plans)</h2>\n<h3><a href=\"https://serp.ly/canva/\">Canva</a></h3>\n<p>When it comes to Pro plans, Canva really comes into its own.</p>\n<p><strong>You get everything the free plan has, including:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>75 million+ images</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>2.5 million+ videos</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>500,000 ready-made premium templates</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>16 different animation styles</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>custom font uploads on top of the 3000+ existing free fonts</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>resizing designs to any dimensions to share on third-party platforms</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>removing any background regardless of color</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>100 GB of storage</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>unlimited folders for organization and sharing</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>unlimited downloads in high quality without watermarks</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>better team collaboration features</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>a social media planner to post scheduled content on different social media platforms directly from Canva</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>downloading vectors</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>your own custom brand kit for your company’s logo, colors, designs, fonts, etc.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Crello</h3>\n<p><strong>Alongside its free plan, offers the following features with Crello Pro:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>no download limit</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>team collaboration</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>background remover, regardless of the background color</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>We Recommend Canva!</h3>\n<p>We loved them, and think you will too.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://serp.ly/canva\">Click Here For An Invite To Canva</a></p>\n<h3>Still Can’t Decide?</h3>\n<p>You can also check our single full review about <a href=\"https://serp.ly/canva\">Canva</a> and <a href=\"https://devinschumacher.com/review/crello\">Crello</a>.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>As you can see, Crello struggles to compete with the sheer number of features that Canva offers. Canva is the industry giant for a reason, with some features simply too good to ignore.</p>\n<p>Even though Canva is slightly more expensive than Crello, the benefits far outweigh Crello’s limitations.</p>\n<p>For most people, from freelancers to small business owners to full-fledged enterprises, Canva offers pricing and features at all levels which will satisfy most users.</p>\n<p>While Crello’s animation features are impressive and beat Canva in some departments, Canva’s pro features like the content planner, vector downloading, team collaboration, and brand kit keep it at the top of the ladder when it comes to online graphic design tools.</p>\n<p>Top Pick</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p>RECOMMENDATION</p>\n<p>Canva is the one of the best tools you can use!

For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you join Kajabi, you can get a free trial for 30 days. But after that, you have to pay. Teachable has plans that don&#39;t cost anything, which we like.</li>\n<li>Kajabi has limits as far as how many online courses you can create and sell. Teachable doesn&#39;t; even on the free plan, you can create and sell unlimited online courses.</li>\n<li>Kajabi is more of an all-in-one tool that you can use to create and sell online courses. Teachable primarily focuses on course creation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Kajabi Online Course Creation - In Depth</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://serp.ly/kajabi/\">Kajabi</a> is an online business platform that allows you to do lots of things, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build a website</li>\n<li>Create your online course</li>\n<li>Create landing pages</li>\n<li>Launch your marketing campaigns</li>\n<li>Manage all your lists and contacts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Kajabi is integrated really well, so you won&#39;t need any type of add-ons or other services to accomplish your goals.</p>\n<p>You don&#39;t even have to know how to code, which we think is amazing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Kajabi has customizable email capabilities, and they make it easy to set up an email campaign in just a few minutes.</p>\n<p>The rest of their platform is customizable too, and you can choose from their own pre-made templates or start from scratch if that&#39;s what you&#39;re into.</p>\n<h3>What are the Main Features of Kajabi?</h3>\n<p>Kajabi has a long list of features and marketing tools that you can use to reach your audience.

They&#39;ll be able to access your website, blog, and lots of engaging tools (such as quizzes, surveys, and any assignments you send out).</p>\n<p>As far as online learning goes, your students will enjoy everything from your basic features to your more in-depth ones.</p>\n<h3>What are the Benefits of Kajabi?</h3>\n<p>When you use Kajabi:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can use their built-in email marketing platform to create amazing emails - and automate them too - without having to invest in different software.</li>\n<li>You can use the Kajabi page builder to create a landing page and sales funnels for your digital products.</li>\n<li>You can keep notes on your customers or students and use tags to create more targeted email campaigns.</li>\n<li>You can create online courses that come complete with quizzes and assignments for your students.</li>\n<li>You can create a membership site.</li>\n<li>You can take advantage of their extensive template library, which will help you build your website, pages, and marketing funnels to market your own brand.</li>\n<li>You&#39;ll never have to worry about paying transaction fees on your courses or digital product sales.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What are the Downsides to Using Kajabi?</h3>\n<p>Kajabi is a fantastic tool, but its price might be the only thing holding it back from being the best.</p>\n<p>There is no free subscription plan available through this platform, and even their most basic plan has some marketing limitations.</p>\n<p>If you&#39;re hoping to utilize an affiliate program through your online course business, this might not be the best option for you, either (unless you upgrade your plan).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<h2>Teachable Online Course Platform - In Depth</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://serp.ly/teachable/\">Teachable</a> is an insanely popular online course platform - it has more than 83,000 instructors and over 23 million students, worldwide.</p>\n<p>We love the simplicity of Teachable, and even if you have never done anything like this before, you&#39;ll have no trouble getting the hang of it.</p>\n<p>Your course website will look awesome, and it will be really easy for your students to navigate it.</p>\n<p>Set-up is quick and simple, and in just a few minutes, you&#39;ll have all the tools you need to get started with selling online courses.</p>\n<h3>What are the Main Features in Teachable?</h3>\n<p>You&#39;ll find that Teachable has some great features too.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Free Teachable domain (or you can buy and use your own custom domain).</li>\n<li>Website builder</li>\n<li>Quizzes</li>\n<li>Coupons and promotions</li>\n<li>Affiliate program</li>\n<li>Reporting and analytics</li>\n<li>Multimedia lectures</li>\n<li>Fully responsive pages</li>\n<li>Advanced customizations with their Power Editor</li>\n<li>Course completion certificates for your students</li>\n<li>Student feedback capability</li>\n<li>Integrations with many third-party software programs</li>\n<li>International payments</li>\n<li>SSL Certificate</li>\n<li>Student list segmentation</li>\n<li>Course compliance</li>\n<li>Advanced pricing</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What is the Teachable Student Experience Like?</h3>\n<p>Where Teachable may be lacking is that it does not offer as many custom options as Kajabi does.</p>\n<p>But you do have a lot more versatility with the Teachable platform. For example, you can offer courses in many other languages.</p>\n<p>Their landing page is very visual and engaging, which can help your students get more interested in learning.</p>\n<p>And once your students are ready to begin your online course, they&#39;ll love how simple the layout is.</p>\n<h3>What are the Benefits of Teachable?</h3>\n<p>When you choose Teachable vs.Kajabi, you&#39;ll love the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As far as pricing plans go, they offer a free plan that you can try out before making a commitment.</li>\n<li>Even on the paid plans, Teachable is a really affordable option for online course creation.</li>\n<li>Their online courses are fully responsive, so matter what device your students are using, they&#39;ll always look their best.</li>\n<li>You can include quizzes to keep your students engaged and learning.</li>\n<li>Your students won&#39;t be able to do more than one course at a time, which is great for keeping them from getting too far ahead.</li>\n<li>The ease of Teachable can&#39;t be beat.</li>\n<li>The course structure is very simple to navigate, both for you and your students.</li>\n<li>Teachable offers a way to bundle your courses and products together so you can increase your revenue.</li>\n<li>You can easily sell your digital products and courses through an affiliate program, if you choose.</li>\n<li>Every plan - even the basic plan - allows you to create unlimited courses.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What are the Downsides to Using Teachable?</h3>\n<p>There are a few things about Teachable that we aren&#39;t too fond of.</p>\n<p>Some of their marketing features leave a little to be desired. For example, they don&#39;t have integrated email marketing.</p>\n<p>But, their platform integrates well with other apps, websites, and third-party tools, so you can seamlessly connect your own email marketing software.</p>\n<p>You&#39;re also going to encounter some fees - even on the free plan and basic plan. We recommend that you just factor these costs into the prices of your courses.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://devinschumacher.com/review/teachable/\">Check out our full review on Teachable here</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<h2>Kajabi vs.Teachable: Price</h2>\n<p>If you&#39;re hoping to sell courses online, you&#39;ll want to know exactly how much you&#39;re going to pay to get your content out there.</p>\n<p>When it comes to Kajabi vs.Teachable, course creation certainly isn&#39;t cheap, but it doesn&#39;t have to break the bank, either.</p>\n<h3>Kajabi Pricing</h3>\n<p>If you go with <a href=\"https://serp.ly/kajabi/\">Kajabi</a>, you&#39;ll find that they have three different pricing plans available. Let&#39;s look at them each individually.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that there are ZERO transaction fees for all of their plans.</p>\n<h4>The Basic Plan</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>$119 a month when you pay for it a year in advance.</li>\n<li>You get 3 products and 3 pipelines.</li>\n<li>There are unlimited landing page builder options.</li>\n<li>You get an unlimited amount of marketing emails.</li>\n<li>You can have 10,000 contacts and 1,000 active members.</li>\n<li>You have 1 website for your online business and 1 admin user.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>The Growth Plan</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>$159 a month when you pay for it for a whole year.</li>\n<li>You get 15 products and 15 pipelines.</li>\n<li>There are unlimited landing pages.</li>\n<li>Unlimited marketing emails.</li>\n<li>25,000 contacts and 10,000 active members.</li>\n<li>You have 1 website and as many as 10 admin users.</li>\n<li>Advanced automation.</li>\n<li>Remove any Kajabi branding.</li>\n<li>Access to their affiliate program.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>The Professional Plan (Pro Plan)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>$319 a month when paid a year in advance.</li>\n<li>You get 100 products and 100 pipelines.</li>\n<li>Unlimited landing pages.</li>\n<li>2,000,000 marketing emails.</li>\n<li>100,000 contacts and 20,000 active members (not quite unlimited students, but close).</li>\n<li>You have up to 3 websites and up to 25 admin users.</li>\n<li>Advanced automation.</li>\n<li>The ability to remove Kajabi branding.</li>\n<li>Access to their affiliate program.</li>\n<li>Access to the code editor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://serp.ly/kajabi/\">Click here to check out Kajabi for free</a>.</p>\n<h3>Teachable Pricing</h3>\n<p>You&#39;ll find that <a href=\"https://serp.ly/teachable/\">Teachable</a> is a lot more affordable, which is one of the main reasons people often choose it over Kajabi.</p>\n<p>They also have 3 different paid plans you can choose from, but there is a free plan too.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that with Teachable, all of the plans (including the free plan) include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Instant and monthly payouts.</li>\n<li>Unlimited bandwidth.</li>\n<li>Unlimited hosting.</li>\n<li>Lecture comments.</li>\n<li>Basic quizzes.</li>\n<li>Student management.</li>\n<li>Email support</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>The Free Plan</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>100% free, but there is a $1 + 10% transaction fee on all paid courses.</li>\n<li>You can have as many as 10 students for your courses.</li>\n<li>You get 1 admin user.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>The Basic Plan</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>$29 per month, billed every year.</li>\n<li>You get everything from the Free plan.</li>\n<li>You get unlimited students.</li>\n<li>You get a custom domain.</li>\n<li>There are coupon codes available.</li>\n<li>You get access to their integrated affiliate program.</li>\n<li>There are some great integrated email marketing tools.</li>\n<li>You can take advantage of their third-party integrations.</li>\n<li>Drip content.</li>\n<li>You get 2 admin-level users.</li>\n<li>This plan does charge 5% fees on all of your paid courses.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>The Professional Plan</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>$79 a month, billed every year.</li>\n<li>Includes all the essential tools from the Basic plan.</li>\n<li>You get live chat support.</li>\n<li>Graded quizzes for your students.</li>\n<li>Course completion certificates.</li>\n<li>Advanced developer customization is available.</li>\n<li>Advanced reporting.</li>\n<li>A completely unbranded website.</li>\n<li>Have up to 5 admin-level users.</li>\n<li>There are no fees when you choose this plan for your course creation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>The Business Plan</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>$399 a month, billed every year.</li>\n<li>Includes everything from the Professional Plan.</li>\n<li>Custom user roles.</li>\n<li>Bulk import your students.</li>\n<li>Up to 100 admin-level users.</li>\n<li>There are no fees you&#39;re required to pay on paid courses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://serp.ly/teachable/\">Click here to check out Teachable for free.</a></p>\n<h2>Kajabi vs.Teachable: Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n<p>Now that you have the basic information you need, let&#39;s answer some of the burning questions you might have about choosing Teachable vs.Kajabi.</p>\n<h3>What Should You Consider Before Deciding Between Kajabi and Teachable?</h3>\n<p>There are several key points you will want to consider when you&#39;re trying to decide on an online course creator:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How many students will you be teaching?</strong> This is important for you to know. Like we mentioned above, you can have a different amount of students with Kajabi, based on the type of plan you choose. But with Teachable, you can have unlimited courses and students, which is really nice.</li>\n<li><strong>What email provider do you plan to use?</strong> In our opinion, one of Kajabi&#39;s best marketing features is its email services. They have their own email platform that you can take advantage of, but it also integrates with many others (MailChimp, Drip, etc.). With Teachable, they use a service called Zapier that integrates with your chosen email service provider.</li>\n<li><strong>What payment processor do you use?</strong> Kajabi has limited options (Stripe and PayPal only), whereas Teachable has many (Stripe, PayPal, Mastercard, Visa, and American Express). So if you want more options, Teachable might be the way go to.</li>\n<li><strong>Do you have mobile students?</strong> Kajabi doesn&#39;t have an app, so your students will be stuck at their computers as they learn. Teachable offers an app for iPhone users, which is really nice.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Are There Limits for Courses and Student Enrollments?</h3>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Basically, Teachable allows you to have unlimited courses and student enrollments.</p>\n<p>Not the case with Kajabi.</p>\n<p>As your online business grows, you will probably have to upgrade your plan in order to keep providing your services to your students.</p>\n<h2>Can You Build Your Own Pipelines or Sales Pages?</h2>\n<p>This is one of the things we really like about Kajabi vs.Teachable. There really is no beating its marketing tools.</p>\n<p>You can build one awesome sales page (or more, if you choose).</p>\n<p>Teachable is really lacking in this area, but it&#39;s excellent in other areas, so it really depends on what your individual needs are as you sell courses.</p>\n<h2>The Bottom Line: Which is Best for Selling Online Courses - Kajabi or Teachable?</h2>\n<p>We can see some pros and cons with both Kajabi and Teachable.</p>\n<p>But in all honesty, we have to admit that Teachable wins the match for the best online course platform.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s why.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pricing</strong> - We love that Teachable has a free plan, which helps you get started right away if you don&#39;t have a lot of money to spend on your online business currently. Plus, the paid plans are still about three times more affordable than Kajabi.</li>\n<li><strong>Course compliance</strong> - You can enforce a lot of things with this platform, like the order of your lectures, videos, and quiz completion.</li>\n<li><strong>Certifications</strong> - We don&#39;t care who you are, when you finish something, it feels good to have that certification of completion in your hands. With Kajabi, you could always make your own, but we like that Teachable has that built right into its platform.</li>\n<li><strong>Unlimited courses</strong> - Let&#39;s face it; unlimited anything is really good. You never know when a stroke of genius is going to hit you and you&#39;re going to want to create a new course. With Teachable, you can. With Kajabi, you can&#39;t.</li>\n<li><strong>App availability</strong> - Everybody and their grandma is mobile now, so having an app so your students can learn on the go is a really big plus in our opinion.</li>\n<li><strong>Time</strong> - Even though Kajabi is a great way to start your online business because of its sales pages and other stellar features, we like that Teachable takes a lot less time to set up.

The first two things you need are some device to stream from, like a PC, video game console, or phone, and an internet connection. </p>\n<p>The next thing you will need is broadcasting software. This software encodes what your device is seeing and broadcasts it out to the world on one of the many streaming platforms. </p>\n<p>Two of the top options for broadcasting software are <a href=\"https://serp.ly/streamlabs/\">Streamlabs</a> OBS and <a href=\"https://serp.ly/obs/\">OBS Studio</a>.  There are many differences and similarities between these two platforms but in this post, we’re going to delve into the pros and cons of each, what you might need to spend to use the software, and which one would be best for your needs. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p><strong>RECOMMENDATION</strong>S 👍</p>\n<p>We recommend using either Streamlabs or OBS Studio!

As a result, almost every other <a href=\"https://devinschumacher.com/streaming-software/\">streaming software</a> is influenced by the code found in OBS Studio. </p>\n<p>OBS stands for Open Broadcaster Software and is free to use and open-source, meaning that anyone can view the code. This allows coders and developers to create other projects like Streamlabs OBS or create plug-ins and add-ons to improve OBS, as we’ll see below. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/streamlabs-vs-obs-image-1743439923490.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/streamlabs-vs-obs-image-1743439923490.jpg\"></p>\n<h3>OBS Studio Pros</h3>\n<h4>Open-Source Coding</h4>\n<p>Even though we just mentioned it, open-source is one of the best things about OBS. Any bugs or glitches get resolved pretty quickly because so many people can review the code and developers can create plugins any time they want to. </p>\n<h4>Simple Interface</h4>\n<p>It might not be the sleekest interface in the world but when you open OBS Studio, you can basically get to everything you need in one or two easy clicks. In addition, the preview screen makes it easy to see what changes you’re making to the broadcast, and changing scenes or turning off sources can be done just as fast. </p>\n<h4>Options for Settings</h4>\n<p>One thing that you’re going to constantly be doing in your broadcasting is changing settings. Depending on how good (or bad) your computer is, affects how your broadcast or stream will be run. OBS makes it easy to change things like Resolution, Bit Rate, FPS, and more. </p>\n<h4>Low CPU Usage</h4>\n<p>Whether you’re streaming games, broadcasting for work, or just chatting online using OBS, one important thing is to make sure your broadcasting software isn’t using a lot of your CPU capacity.</p>\n<p>OBS uses a lot less of your CPU than platforms like Streamlabs which makes you able to do other things like gaming or running other programs much more smoother. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/streamlabs-vs-obs-image-1743439923570.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/streamlabs-vs-obs-image-1743439923570.jpg\"></p>\n<h3>OBS Studio Cons</h3>\n<h4>No Alerts Integration</h4>\n<p>If you’re broadcasting to a platform like Twitch or YouTube, one thing streamers do is have an alert that comes up when someone follows, subscribes, or donates.</p>\n<p>OBS doesn’t have a way for you to do this just with this platform, so you’d have to use Streamlabs or Streamelements to make this happen although the process is straightforward. </p>\n<h4>Not Beginner Friendly</h4>\n<p>Now, we mentioned that the interface is simple to use but if you are a novice in technical things, OBS doesn’t have the easiest path to understanding how to use the software. </p>\n<h4>Missing Some Bells and Whistles</h4>\n<p>Besides the alerts integration, OBS doesn’t have an internal plugin or app for things like integrated chats, event queues, and other things that make streams stand out. Just like with alerts though, you can use something like Streamlabs to add these to OBS. </p>\n<h3>OBS Pricing</h3>\n<p>OBS Studio is 100% free and every feature possible is available at the free level. In addition, some plugins or apps can be used in OBS that you would need to pay for but aren’t necessary at all. Basically, everything you need to run a stream can be done for free using OBS Studio.</p>\n<p>Snag your quote for <a href=\"https://serp.ly/obs/\">OBS</a>.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://serp.ly/streamlabs/\">Streamlabs OBS</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://serp.ly/streamlabs/\">Streamlabs OBS</a>, also known as SLOBS, was released as an easy-to-use beginner-friendly streaming platform. It basically takes everything you need from OBS Studio and puts it in a smoother user interface and has extra apps and plugins (both free and paid) to allow you to add on to your streaming or broadcasting experience. </p>\n<p>You can add twitch overlays, multiple webcams, audio sources, and games and displays, all with a few easy clicks. Most people can get set up and stream in less than an hour. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/streamlabs-vs-obs-image-1743439923585.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/streamlabs-vs-obs-image-1743439923585.jpg\"></p>\n<h3>Streamlabs OBS Pros</h3>\n<h4>Streamlabs Cloudbot</h4>\n<p>Every streamer needs a bot to use commands, ban viewers if needed, thank people for following, and more. Streamlabs gives you moderation tools and commands, along with letting you run polls, play games with your chat, and allow chat to do things like heists. </p>\n<h4>Automated Setup</h4>\n<p>Right when you install Streamlabs OBS, it walks you through everything you need to be able to broadcast within the first 15 minutes. Then, SLOBS runs tests to determine your bandwidth and CPU capabilities and gives you settings that they recommend for your stream based on your equipment. </p>\n<h4>Design Options</h4>\n<p>One of the reasons most people pick SLOBS over OBS Studio is the capabilities you can have in designing the stream the way you want to. Streamlabs has webcam overlays, themes, widgets, and plugins that allow you to do everything from creating a border around your webcam and game to transitions between scenes and intermission screens. </p>\n<h4>Alert Integration</h4>\n<p>When someone follows or subscribes to your stream, you want to thank them. However, as Streamlabs has, you can’t do that without an alert integration on platforms like OBS.</p>\n<p>You can use SLOBS default alerts or they have free animations and sounds that you can use. You can also import your own gifs or pictures to use. </p>\n<h4>Other Free Widgets and Plugins</h4>\n<p>Besides the plugins we’ve already mentioned, you have other widgets and apps that you can use like putting your chatbox on your screen, rotating a sponsor banner, media shares to pop up videos on stream that your chat wants to see, and more. </p>\n<p>You can also add follower, subscription, or donation goals to incentivize viewers to support you along your journey. </p>\n<h4>Streamlabs Prime</h4>\n<p>Streamlabs Prime can be a section all by itself and we will go through it more below but this is when we’re entering parts of Streamlabs where you have to pay. We’ll go over the pricing below but with the paid version, you get access to premium animated overlays, additional apps, your own custom merch store, sponsorships, and more. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/streamlabs-vs-obs-image-1743439923597.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/streamlabs-vs-obs-image-1743439923597.jpg\"></p>\n<h4>Multi-Stream Integration</h4>\n<p>One other thing you get access to if you have prime is the ability to Multistream. This means that you can be live on Twitch, YouTube, and Facebook simultaneously, for example. All three chats will come through your chat box as one and this helps you gain exposure on three platforms and future-proof your account in case anything happens. </p>\n<h3>Streamlabs OBS Cons</h3>\n<h4>CPU Intensive</h4>\n<p>Probably the biggest knock that anyone can have on Streamlabs is how much CPU usage it uses on your computer. If you have a budget-level computer, this might cause an issue for you and even if you have a modest computer, using SLOBS and playing some of the most CPU-heavy games might cause lag as well. In addition, because of all the extra apps and plugins, Streamlabs can drag your game, stream, and CPU all down. </p>\n<h4>Features Behind Paywall</h4>\n<p>Obviously, Streamlabs has to make money somehow, but leaving things like the multistream functionality and animated overlays behind paywalls can be seen as a negative if you are looking not to spend money. </p>\n<h3>Streamlabs OBS Pricing</h3>\n<p>If you want to use Streamlabs OBS and get online to stream on any of your preferred streaming platforms, that is 100% free to do with SLOBS. You get the broadcasting software along with their free widgets, apps, and themes/overlays. </p>\n<p>Now, if you want to upgrade to the Streamlabs Prime plan, you can sign up with an annual plan, quarterly plan, or monthly plan. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Annual Plan – $149/year</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Quarterly Plan – $45 every three months or $180 for the year. </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Monthly Plan – $19/month or $228 for the year</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/streamlabs-vs-obs-image-1743439923649.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/streamlabs-vs-obs-image-1743439923649.jpg\"></p>\n<p>If you want to get the equivalent of OBS Studio in the Streamlabs version, you don’t have to pay anything to get that. Instead, you get everything that comes with the free package if you install SLOBS and go through the fast setup and you’re ready to go. </p>\n<p>Snag your quote for <a href=\"https://serp.ly/streamlabs/\">Streamlabs</a>.</p>\n<h2>What Is Broadcasting Software?</h2>\n<p>Broadcasting software allows streamers or other parties to encode and broadcast their stream out to different streaming platforms. The software will allow you to set up how the stream will look and function, what video or game would be on the screen along with the audio playing. </p>\n<h2>Why Do Streamers Need Broadcasting Software?</h2>\n<p>If someone wants to stream onto popular streaming platforms, you have to use broadcasting software. Without one, you would have no way of recording and streaming the video and audio from your computer to other people’s devices. </p>\n<h2>Can You Use Streamlabs with OBS?</h2>\n<p>Streamlabs has an integration that works with OBS Studio. You can use Streamlabs Alerts and other widgets like the Chat Box and Event Queues. Many streamers do this to save on CPU with OBS open and Streamlabs only operating when alerts go off.  </p>\n<h2>Does Streamlabs OBS Cost Money?</h2>\n<p>Streamlabs OBS is 100% free. They have a premium version where you can use their premium themes, premium apps and plugins, and more. All of the software that you need to start streaming or broadcasting is available for free, though. </p>\n<h2>What Do You Get with Streamlabs Prime?</h2>\n<p>When it comes to upgrading, here is everything you get with Streamlabs Prime. </p>\n<h3>Pro Themes</h3>\n<p>Customize your stream with the best overlays, graphics, and themes that work on Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, and more.</p>\n<h3>Multi-Stream</h3>\n<p>Stream to multiple platforms at the same time. For example, you can stream to Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, and more at once to expand your reach and grow. </p>\n<h3>40+ Apps</h3>\n<p>Streamlabs App Store has apps that help give you better automation, sponsorship opportunities, better analytics, and other ways to interact with viewers. </p>\n<h3>Custom Tip Page</h3>\n<p>When viewers want to donate money, you send them to a customized page to entice people to support you more. </p>\n<h3>Custom Merch Store</h3>\n<p>Let your viewers shop directly from your website. They take care of the printing, shipping, and support. </p>\n<h3>Panel Library</h3>\n<p>Panels are the sections below the stream that let viewers donate, buy merch, visit your socials, and more. </p>\n<h3>Custom Cloudbot</h3>\n<p>Take your cloudbot to the next level with a custom bot name. </p>\n<h2>Can You Stream To Multiple Platforms With Streamlabs OBS?</h2>\n<p>Yes. If you have Streamlabs Prime, you can multi-stream to Twitch, Facebook, and YouTube all at the same time. All you need to do is link each account to your Streamlabs OBS and then tell the program to make you go live on each of these platforms when you start streaming. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/streamlabs-vs-obs-image-1743439924032.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/streamlabs-vs-obs-image-1743439924032.jpg\"></p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://serp.ly/streamlabs/\">Streamlabs</a> vs.<a href=\"https://serp.ly/obs/\">OBS Studio</a>: Which Is Better?</h2>\n<p>There is no perfect answer to which is better for every potential streamer. The answer for you can change depending on if you have a budget or high-end computer, or if you are technically inclined, or more of a novice. </p>\n<p>It can also influence your decision based on whether you already have an overlay and theme or if you need one and prefer not to spend any money at all or are willing to spend money to grow your reach. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p><strong>RECOMMENDATION</strong>S 👍</p>\n<p>We recommend using either Streamlabs or OBS Studio!

That should help you make the decision that works best for you.</p>\n<p>But don&#39;t worry - we&#39;ll give you our final verdict too.</p>\n<h2>Thinkific vs.Teachable - An Overview</h2>\n<p>Online learning has absolutely <em>exploded</em> in recent years.</p>\n<p>In fact, <a href=\"https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/elearning-market-size\">Global Market Insights</a> says that it&#39;s an industry that&#39;s poised to grow to a $240 billion industry by 2023.</p>\n<p>Teachable and Thinkific are two of the most popular options for online courses.</p>\n<p>But in order to know which one is right for you, you need to take a look at all the features and compare them.</p>\n<p>No worries. We&#39;ve done that part for you.</p>\n<p>Here are some quick notes about both of these course creation platforms:</p>\n<p><strong>Thinkific...</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>...has more than 40,000 course creators.</li>\n<li>...has 30 million online classes.</li>\n<li>...has about 100 employees.</li>\n<li>...offers its services in more than 15 countries.</li>\n<li>...has easy set-up capabilities.</li>\n<li>...has awesome website design options that are fully customizable.</li>\n<li>...has some fantastic marketing and analytics tools.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Teachable...</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>...has 83,000 instructors.</li>\n<li>...has 23,000,000 students.</li>\n<li>...uses a drag and drop editor to help you build your website.</li>\n<li>...offers some great analytics tools.</li>\n<li>...makes it possible to design optimized landing pages.</li>\n<li>...offers great marketing and sales pages.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now that we&#39;ve gotten that out of the way, let&#39;s take a closer look at the features you can get with both Thinkific and Teachable and how they compare.</p>\n<h2>Performance and Uptime</h2>\n<p>There&#39;s nothing worse than taking online courses only to have the website shut down.</p>\n<p>Well...maybe the only thing worse is having the site shut down while people are in the process of paying so they can get started on your online learning platform.</p>\n<p>We&#39;re talking lost revenue and a tarnished brand image, which are two things we want to avoid.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://serp.ly/thinkific/\">Thinkific</a></h3>\n<p>Thinkific boasts an uptime percentage of 99.9%. That&#39;s pretty darn good.</p>\n<p>They also monitor their website at all hours of the day and night to make sure it&#39;s running like it should.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://serp.ly/teachable/\">Teachable</a></h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, Teachable doesn&#39;t have any information on their website to put your mind at ease about their uptimes.</p>\n<p>They also do constant monitoring, but lots of people have reported errors, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>504 errors and latency.</li>\n<li>Problems with connectivity.</li>\n<li>Difficulty with updating billing info.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Victor: Thinkific</h3>\n<p>We love the transparency shown by Thinkific when it comes to their uptimes.</p>\n<p>Bold move; and the way their customers talk about the Thinkific site, they stand behind that statistic.</p>\n<h2>Course Creation Info</h2>\n<p>There&#39;s nothing worse than getting all excited about the course creation process only to find that the system is too hard to navigate.</p>\n<p>Your online course platform can have all the bells and whistles, but if you can&#39;t manage to set it up, what good is it?</p>\n<h3>Thinkific</h3>\n<p>Thinkific has a lot of great features that make it easy to use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drag and drop your content.</li>\n<li>No coding knowledge is necessary and you can still customize it any way you want.</li>\n<li>Multimedia support is available for videos, surveys, downloads and other types of content.</li>\n<li>Video content gets free hosting.</li>\n<li>The use of pre-built themes.</li>\n<li>Easy <a href=\"https://serp.co/email-marketing/email-marketing-tips/\">email marketing</a> integration.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Teachable</h3>\n<p>Teachable isn&#39;t too shabby either when it comes to its features and their ease of use. You get:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The ability to add all kinds of content - video, text, images, PDF files and audio files - from cloud storage services like Dropbox, OneDrive and Google Docs.</li>\n<li>An easy-to-use drag and drop builder.</li>\n<li>A highly responsive website.</li>\n<li>Their Power Editor to customize all features.</li>\n<li>Their Page Editor to instantly launch new pages with brand-new courses.</li>\n<li>The ability to include many different languages for your online courses.</li>\n<li>Sales templates that are optimized for conversion.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Victor - Teachable</h3>\n<p>While both sites are good, we think Teachable wins the prize for course creation.</p>\n<p>If you&#39;re new to selling online courses, this is where you might want to start simply because of its ease of use.</p>\n<h2>Website Design and Customization</h2>\n<p>There are a lot of similarities between Thinkific and Teachable as far as website design and customization go.</p>\n<p>But there are also some unique differences.</p>\n<h3>Thinkific</h3>\n<p>When you sell courses online with Thinkific, you get:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your choice of 10 attractive, custom theme presets that are designed specifically for the purpose of online course creation.</li>\n<li>The ability to create, modify, import and export themes across various sites.</li>\n<li>Access to theme code so you can modify it and make it truly yours.</li>\n<li>A live preview of your site changes in real-time, so there&#39;s never any question about what your site will look like.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Teachable</h3>\n<p>When you use Teachable, you&#39;ll find that they offer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The ability to quickly set up an intuitive website without a lot of need for configuration.</li>\n<li>Quick setup - all you need is an email address and the name of your school or program.</li>\n<li>Quizzes and a place for student discussions.</li>\n<li>High levels of customization, but you don&#39;t need to know anything about coding to do it.</li>\n<li>Commenting and emailing capabilities for students so you can build your own online learning community.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Victor - Thinkific</h3>\n<p>Thinkific wins this round because of how customizable it is.</p>\n<p>Branding is really important, and the fact that they offer so many themes that are so easy to implement cannot be ignored here.</p>\n<h2>Security</h2>\n<p>Any time a website collects payments from people online, it should have the utmost in security features.</p>\n<p>Fraud is a real thing, and cybersecurity attacks and breaches happen every single day.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, these two sites have strong security measures in place.</p>\n<h3>Thinkific</h3>\n<p>Thinkific takes both an offensive and a defensive stance when it comes to security.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They monitor their platform all day every day to make sure they can act quickly in the event of a breach.</li>\n<li>They periodically and automatically roll out security updates so you&#39;ll never miss them.</li>\n<li>Your data is automatically backed up, and it is stored in the cloud, so you won&#39;t have to worry about losing it.</li>\n<li>The platform has seamless, built-in SSL certificates so you can know that your content is stored in secured servers.</li>\n<li>You maintain absolute ownership of your data.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Teachable</h3>\n<p>Teachable isn&#39;t too shabby either. With their course builder, you get:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PCI level-1 compliant payment provider integration.</li>\n<li>A 2048-bit SSL certificate, so your student&#39;s data is always protected.</li>\n<li>Automatic security updates.</li>\n<li>Complete control and ownership of your data.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Victor - Thinkific</h3>\n<p>Both Teachable and Thinkific are strong when it comes to data security.</p>\n<p>But because of Thinkific&#39;s commitment to 99.9% uptime and additional security features, they are the winners this round.</p>\n<h2>Marketing and Sales Capabilities</h2>\n<p>Marketing and sales are really important when you&#39;re trying to make money online.</p>\n<p>After all, if you can&#39;t get the word out about your online courses, how will you attract students?</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s take a closer look at how Thinkific and Teachable do in this area.</p>\n<h3>Thinkific</h3>\n<p>Thinkific offers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An affiliate marketing program (which we&#39;ll talk more about in just a minute) that allows you to incentivize other people to share about your online courses.</li>\n<li>The ability to connect with whatever email provider you choose to send out personalized email marketing campaigns.</li>\n<li>Easy integration with more than 1,000 external marketing tools.</li>\n<li>Use data tracking to optimize your marketing campaigns.</li>\n<li>Get support through analytics and ad tracking for Google AdWords, Facebook and other remarketing campaigns.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Teachable</h3>\n<p>Teachable offers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Its own affiliate marketing program.</li>\n<li>The ability to use coupon codes to get new users to join, or to encourage your current students to share your online course with their friends and family.</li>\n<li>Customized pricing plans that include subscription payment plans, one-time fees or the ability to bulk sell courses.</li>\n<li>A fantastic landing page builder feature.</li>\n<li>The ability to accept payments in more than 130 international currencies.</li>\n<li>Integration with marketing tools like MailChimp, Infusionsoft and others.</li>\n<li>Conversion pixels that that be added to your website so you can keep track of how effective your marketing tools are.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Victor - Teachable</h3>\n<p>Teachable wins this round because of all the marketing and sales tools it has to offer.</p>\n<p>You really can&#39;t beat optimized and personalized marketing campaigns, and they do it very well.</p>\n<h2>Advanced Site Administration and Developer Features</h2>\n<p>Not everyone is going to need advanced site administration and developer features for their online learning platform.</p>\n<p>But if you do, you want to know that your developers will be able to go behind the scenes and do what they need to do to make your courses shine.</p>\n<h3>Thinkific</h3>\n<p>Developers love Thinkific because it offers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An app store that allows for each integration with professional tools so your site can stand out.</li>\n<li>A full-featured API.</li>\n<li>A single sign-on for your students using JSON web tokens.</li>\n<li>The ability to create, modify, import and export site themes across many sites.</li>\n<li>Full access to your theme&#39;s code with private testing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Teachable</h3>\n<p>Teachable wasn&#39;t designed for developers.</p>\n<p>It was designed to make it easy for everyday entrepreneurs to be able to sell courses online.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, Teachable:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Doesn&#39;t have an app store or API.</li>\n<li>Does not offer support for themes and a developer will not be able to import or export code.</li>\n<li>Gives developers basic assess to html/css.</li>\n<li>Live editing with no private testing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Victor -Thinkific</h3>\n<p>If being able to code is important to you - and it might be for the best possible student experience - you should go with Thinkific.</p>\n<p>Your course content might be small now, but this capability gives your business the ability to grow.</p>\n<h2>Data Analytics</h2>\n<p>Without data analytics, any marketing you do with your online course is just a shot in the dark.</p>\n<p>You want to know that your efforts are getting you somewhere, so the more insight you can get, the better.</p>\n<h3>Thinkific</h3>\n<p>When you choose Thinkific vs.Teachable:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You get easy integration with data anaylitics, and this includes Facebook, Google Adwords and other tools.</li>\n<li>You can use filters to check the status of individual students.</li>\n<li>You can choose select groups of people to receive email broadcasts.</li>\n<li>You can run highly targeted campaigns for certain groups of students.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Teachable</h3>\n<p>With Teachable:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can use its comprehensive dashboard to track student signups as well as your revenue within periods of time that you choose.</li>\n<li>You can check for lecture completion rates and sort them based on your students.</li>\n<li>You can export student data and revenue information to get more insight into your online business.</li>\n<li>You can use Zapier to send customized, course-related events to a number of different marketing tools.</li>\n<li>You can find out which marketing campaign resulted in student conversions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Victor - Teachable</h3>\n<p>When comparing Teachable vs.Thinkific with regard to analytics, Teachable is the clear winner.</p>\n<p>Their suite of analytic tools cannot be beat, and they offer the best for what you need to learn more about your efforts.</p>\n<h2>The Student Experience</h2>\n<p>When you create an online course platform that your students enjoy, everyone is happy.</p>\n<p>You make money.</p>\n<p>They learn stuff.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s a win-win.</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s see how Teachable and Thinkific match up in this area.</p>\n<h3>Thinkific</h3>\n<p>We don&#39;t mind saying that Thinkific&#39;s students are pretty happy with the platform.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the highlights they enjoy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Custom emails (which can change course-by-course) to welcome them and congratulate them when they&#39;re finished.</li>\n<li>Customized URLs for payment pages so your students know they&#39;re in the right place when they make payments.</li>\n<li>Terrific mobile responsiveness for a seamless experience no matter what device they&#39;re using.</li>\n<li>Over 30 languages available.</li>\n<li>A custom student dashboard that is engaging and attractive.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Teachable</h3>\n<p>Where Teachable really shines is in student communications. Their platform:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gives an opportunity for students to chat with each other.</li>\n<li>Offers direct messaging capabilities.</li>\n<li>Provides surveys and quizzes to gauge student learning and progress.</li>\n<li>They have a commenting feature on each lecture, which is nice.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Victor - Tie</h3>\n<p>To be honest, this one was close.</p>\n<p>We think Teachable wins as far as communication goes, but the features Thinkific offers are really top-notch.</p>\n<h2>Customer Service Support</h2>\n<p>When you&#39;re new to creating online course content, you need all the help you can get.</p>\n<p>Knowing that you have a stellar customer service support team behind you is awesome.</p>\n<p>Between these two platforms, they both offer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Online tutorials</li>\n<li>Helpful onboarding emails</li>\n<li>Facebook groups where you can get questions answered</li>\n<li>A wide knowledge base</li>\n<li>Support tickets</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let&#39;s see who wins between Teachable vs.Thinkific.</p>\n<h3>Thinkific</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, Thinkific doesn&#39;t have a way of getting in touch with customer support directly because they don&#39;t offer real-time support.</p>\n<p>That&#39;s a real bummer, but you can fill out a form to get in touch with the CS team; you just have to wait for a response.</p>\n<h3>Teachable</h3>\n<p>Teachable offers live chat support when you choose their Professional Plan.</p>\n<p>There&#39;s really no beating that.</p>\n<h3>The Victor - Teachable</h3>\n<p>Like we said, there&#39;s no beating live support.</p>\n<p>Teachable wins this one, hands-down.</p>\n<h2>Teaching and Site Administration</h2>\n<p>When it comes to Teachable vs.Thinkific, this is one area in which they both really shine.</p>\n<p>Both sites offer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ease in creating, marketing, selling and managing your course platform.</li>\n<li>Ownership and exporting abilities for student data.</li>\n<li>Comprehensive progress tracking.</li>\n<li>Reporting and analytics.</li>\n<li>Unlimited students for enrollment.</li>\n<li>Delivery of student course completion certificates.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But there are some ways in which they differ too.</p>\n<h3>Thinkific</h3>\n<p>When you choose Thinkific, you get:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The ability to organize your students into groups for easy reporting and selling.</li>\n<li>Full user administration on your site.</li>\n<li>Easy payment tracking so you&#39;re always in the know.</li>\n<li>Custom signup fields, so you&#39;re in control over what information comes from your students.</li>\n<li>Bookmarking presets so you can get real-time information on your students&#39; progress.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Teachable</h3>\n<p>With Teachable, you get:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fewer site admin capabilities, such as the inability to update student names and emails.</li>\n<li>The ability to pay your site authors and affiliates as well as collect and send tax forms.</li>\n<li>A lot of user permission options that go beyond the basic ones offered by Thinkific.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Victor - Thinkific</h3>\n<p>We have to admit - we like being in control.</p>\n<p>We appreciate the amount of control Thinkific offers you, which gives you more freedom to do what you need to do with everything from course reporting to advanced data tracking.</p>\n<h2>Payment Integrations</h2>\n<p>Robust and secure payment integration is something that people are looking for when they sign up for online courses.</p>\n<p>Both Thinkific and Teachable accept Stripe and PayPal, but there are a few characteristics that differentiate them from one another too.</p>\n<h3>Thinkific</h3>\n<p>Have you ever encountered a failed Stripe transaction? It happens.</p>\n<p>But Thinkific uses Stunning, which can help prevent them.</p>\n<p>As far as taxes go, Thinkific offers reliable third-party integration with the right tools to help you get the job done.</p>\n<h3>Teachable</h3>\n<p>Teachable can handle VAT (value-added taxes) for the United States.</p>\n<p>But it has an automatic EU VAT collection feature that a lot of experts don&#39;t like.</p>\n<p>Not to mention, it also doesn&#39;t have Stunning.</p>\n<h3>The Victor - Thinkific</h3>\n<p>There really is no contest here.</p>\n<p>We love the fact that Thinkific integrates so well with third-party tools and its taxation capabilities are hands-down better than Teachable&#39;s.</p>\n<h2>Coupon Codes</h2>\n<p>If you remember right, we like to be in control.</p>\n<p>So it makes sense that we would think that you deserve to have as much control over your online learning platform as possible.</p>\n<p>Coupons give you more control, and both Thinkific and Teachable allow you to use them.</p>\n<h3>Thinkific</h3>\n<p>With Thinkific, you&#39;re in the driver&#39;s seat as far as coupons go.</p>\n<p>You can create all kinds of discounts for your students. Here&#39;s what we like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can make your coupons apply to the entire site, or only one or more courses of your choosing.</li>\n<li>Your coupons can be % or $ based - it&#39;s up to you.</li>\n<li>Advanced discounting is available.</li>\n<li>Your coupons can be set up to expire at a certain time that you choose.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Teachable</h3>\n<p>Teachable also offers coupons that you can use when selling courses online.</p>\n<p>When you choose their platform:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You get basic coupon capabilities.</li>\n<li>They do not offer support for coupons that span more than one month.</li>\n<li>They offer percentage-based coupons.</li>\n<li>You can offer certain percentage amounts off specific pricing plans, but that&#39;s it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Victor - Thinkific</h3>\n<p>Once again, Thinkific comes out on top.</p>\n<p>Flexibility is important, and you should be able to set up your online learning platforms in the ways that work best for you.</p>\n<p>That means having more control and ownership over your couponing abilities.</p>\n<h2>Online Course Customization</h2>\n<p>Before you choose a platform to create courses, make sure it allows for as much customization as possible.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s important for your brand to be front-and-center, and if it&#39;s not, or if you don&#39;t have the ability to customize in other ways too, this could spell disaster for your online course.</p>\n<h3>Thinkific</h3>\n<p>Thinkific is great when it comes to course customization.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your students can request courses or lesson in advance with their prerequisite lesson feature.</li>\n<li>Utilize multiple course instructors in real-time so can meet the needs of various students, while boosting your revenue at the same time.</li>\n<li>Use the drip schedule content feature to send out content as quickly or as slowly as you like.</li>\n<li>Integrate with membership sites so you can attract more students.</li>\n<li>Change course availability to private or hidden based on free or paid options.</li>\n<li>Use more than one theme so your lessons always look just the way you want them to.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Teachable</h3>\n<p>Teachable is pretty awesome in this area too.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quickly create intuitive web pages without a lot of configuration.</li>\n<li>Customize the way your site looks and keep it brand-specific.</li>\n<li>Utilize their comment and email features to create an engaging community among your learners.</li>\n<li>Utilize the help of thousands of online instructors to offer high-quality courses.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Victor - Thinkific</h3>\n<p>Though we do like what Teachable has to offer in the area of course customization, we think Thinkific takes the cake here.</p>\n<p>They simply offer you more control, which is just what you need.</p>\n<h2>Blogging and SEO Capabilities</h2>\n<p>If you&#39;re completely new to selling online courses or operating any type of online business, then this is something you need to know...</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://serp.co/blog/how-to-promote-your-blog/\">Blogging</a> and <a href=\"https://devinschumacher.com/what-is-seo/\">SEO</a> are <strong><em>really</em></strong> important.</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s see how these two sites match up.</p>\n<h3>Thinkific</h3>\n<p>Thinkific allows you to blog, but you&#39;ll need to use app store integration to make it happen.</p>\n<p>But the good news is that WordPress and DropInBlog can both be seamlessly integrated with your website.</p>\n<h3>Teachable</h3>\n<p>With Teachable, you get the bonus of built-in blogging functionality.</p>\n<p>Its SEO features are limited, so you won&#39;t get as beautiful a blog as you might get with something like WordPress, but you can get the job done with a very basic blog.</p>\n<h3>The Victor - Tie</h3>\n<p>This is one of those six of one/half a dozen of the other situations.</p>\n<p>You should definitely have a blog on your site, or connected to it in some way.</p>\n<p>The way you go about it is up to you, but both of these solutions can work well.</p>\n<h2>Affiliate Marketing</h2>\n<p>If you&#39;re interested in <a href=\"https://serp.co/affiliate-marketing/affiliate-marketing-for-dummies/\">affiliate marketing</a> as a part of your online course delivery business, both Teachable and Thinkific do it well.</p>\n<p>Both Teachable and Thinkific have integrated affiliate marketing with affiliate dashboards and an option to set custom commission percentages for your affiliates.</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s see how else they compare.</p>\n<h3>Thinkific</h3>\n<p>Thinkific:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does not allow you to set custom affiliate percentages for different courses.</li>\n<li>Does not offer very much customization.</li>\n<li>Allows you to use affiliate features when building your landing pages on a different platform, but only if you know how to code.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Teachable</h3>\n<p>Teachable:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Offers more options for customization than Thinkific does.</li>\n<li>Lets you set up custom cookies for affiliates.</li>\n<li>Lets you use affiliate features when you build your landing pages on a different platform.</li>\n<li>You can automatically pay your affiliates.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Victor - Teachable</h3>\n<p>In our opinion, Teachable seems a little more user-friendly for affiliates. They&#39;re definitely the winner here.</p>\n<h2>Price</h2>\n<p>This is where we get down to the nitty-gritty.</p>\n<p>What can you expect from Thinkific vs.Teachable when it comes to price?</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://serp.ly/thinkific/\">Thinkific</a></h3>\n<p>First, we love that Thinkific offers a free plan because there&#39;s just no beating <strong><em>free</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>If you want to subscribe, and you pay yearly, you&#39;ll enjoy a 20% discount on their Basic, Pro, and Thinkific Plus plans.</p>\n<p>The starting price is just $39 a month for their Basic Plan and $79 a month for their Pro Plan.</p>\n<p>Their Thinkific Plus Plan is customizable, and you can talk with them about your options and get a quote.</p>\n<p>But let&#39;s not gloss over the Free Plan, because it deserves the spotlight too.

      "content": "<p>Video conferencing platforms have been embedded in the business world for a while now, but it wasn&#39;t until the Covid19 epidemic hit that online meetings and conferences became the industry standard. With most companies moving to the WFH system (work-from-home), video conferencing software became an integral part of conducting business.</p>\n<p>The right video conferencing platform can enable you to quickly and efficiently confer with your colleagues, devise plans for the future and delegate tasks, and create a video call with your clients. The reason video conferencing software is preferred over other virtual meeting software such as Skype is that they offer more accessibility and are easier to use.</p>\n<h2>Webex vs.Zoom - An Overview</h2>\n<p>As said before, video conferences have become the norm in the business world. Pair that with high-quality video, group messaging, mobile device access, and some advanced features and it comes as no surprise why this is the case.</p>\n<p>In fact, <a href=\"https://www.trustradius.com/vendor-blog/web-conferencing-statistics-trends\">TrustRadius</a> shows us that <strong>since the Covid19 pandemic began, Webex and Zoom use has gone up by more than 600%!</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p>And while Zoom is currently the market leader in both growth and popularity, Webex software is still a very popular choice. But should popularity be the only metric when you&#39;re choosing which video conferencing software is best for your company?</p>\n<p>Of course, popularity can be interpreted as how good or successful something is, but that isn&#39;t always the case. Take a look at Discord for example - immensely popular yet rarely used in a professional business environment.</p>\n<p>So here&#39;s the breakdown of the Zoom vs Webex question about which one is better. We&#39;ve done the research so you don&#39;t have to.</p>\n<h2>Price &amp; Hosting</h2>\n<p>The price of a product plays a fundamental role in the decision-making process of choosing the right video conferencing platform. Although these video conferencing tools are relatively cheap, it&#39;s important to deduce which one is better. One thing to note though - both Zoom and Webex have a free version but for all intents and purposes, unless your company numbers only a few employees, it&#39;s better to pay for the full software.</p>\n<p>A medium and large company would require plenty of space for participants. The price of each plan directly correlates with the number of supported participants and there are some stark differences between Zoom and Webex.</p>\n<h3>Zoom</h3>\n<p>The Zoom Small Business plan costs $14.99/month for each business account (host). This price tag is nearly the same as the Cisco Webex small business plan. Not a huge difference, but that&#39;s just the starter plan we&#39;re talking about.</p>\n<p>You can also try out the premium version for free before you purchase any of the plans which is a big positive compared to Webex that doesn&#39;t offer a trial version.</p>\n<p>In most cases, the number of video conferencing participants is lower than those using only their voice. Zoom&#39;s most expensive and expansive plan (Enterprise) allows up to 1,000 people to participate in a video conference.</p>\n<p>Cheaper plans support fewer people (100 or 300) but they&#39;re also the more affordable option. With that said, Zoom does offer something called a &#39;Large Meetings&#39; add-on and it isn&#39;t even expensive coming in at $46.50/month.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that you can only purchase the Business and Enterprise plans if you buy a specific minimum number of licenses (10 and 50, respectively).</p>\n<p>Talking about their webinar solutions, you&#39;ll be able to have more than 10,000 participants in one call. That&#39;s a staggeringly high number that you won&#39;t find in any other video conferencing app.</p>\n<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Free plan allows up to 100 participants with a 40-minute time limit</li>\n<li>$14.99/month per host (Small business plan) - supports up to 100 participants</li>\n<li>$19.99/month per host (Medium business plan) - supports up to 300 participants; the minimum number of hosts needed for this plan is 10.</li>\n<li>$19.99/month per host (Large business plan) - supports up to 500 or 1,000 participants; the minimum number of hosts needed for this plan is 100; Cannot be purchased without contacting Zoom</li>\n<li>Expand the number of participants to 1,000 for Small and Medium business plans by purchasing the &#39;Large Meetings&#39; add-on for $50/month</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cisco Webex</h3>\n<p>The Cisco Webex Small Business plan costs $13.50/month per host. A dollar and a half cheaper than Zoom&#39;s with more space for participants.</p>\n<p>Webex also offers a free plan with support up to 100 participants but with a slightly longer time limit than Zoom - 50 minutes.</p>\n<p>The Medium Business plan comes in at $26.95/month per host with an increase in hosting ability; with this plan, you&#39;ll be able to have up to 200 participants.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Cisco Webex doesn&#39;t display their price for the Large Business plan and as such, you&#39;d need to go through the process of contacting them yourself for a personalized quote.</p>\n<p>There is no minimum limit on the number of licenses you need to purchase for a specific plan; this is quite a huge deal considering some businesses want advanced features for their small teams. Because of this, Webex has the advantage here.</p>\n<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Free plan allows up to 100 participants with a 50-minute time limit</li>\n<li>$13.50/month per host (Small business plan) - supports up to 150 participants</li>\n<li>$26.95/month per host (Medium business plan) - supports up to 200 participants</li>\n<li>You must contact Cisco for a personalized quote for the Large business plan; theoretically supports up to 1,000 participants</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Who&#39;s better?</h3>\n<p>To be honest, it&#39;s a pretty tight race between the two. Both Zoom and Cisco offer similar characteristics for a similar price but only one can come out on top. For large-scale business meetings, Zoom takes the cake due to both ease-of-purchase and the number of supported participants. Costing just $19.99 for large virtual meetings and supporting 1,000 Zoom users means that Zoom is more affordable and accessible than Webex.</p>\n<p>However, compared to Zoom, Webex offers a lot of other video conferencing features. Its free plan is also more powerful than Zoom&#39;s which might be great for smaller companies.</p>\n<p>In the end, <strong>Zoom&#39;s video conferencing experience is better for the price than Webex.</strong></p>\n<h2>Video Conferencing Features</h2>\n<p>Creating and hosting video conferencing sessions requires plenty of features that are readily available for businesses and hosts to properly run them. These features range from screen sharing, group meetings, audio &amp; video quality, and more.</p>\n<p>For example, a business may want to record their video webinars or video calls and as such, they&#39;d need screen recording and plenty of storage space. Let&#39;s take a look at what these two offer.</p>\n<h3>Zoom</h3>\n<p>Zoom, in general, <strong>comes with more features and is almost solely oriented towards improving and perfecting the user experience</strong>. Because of this, you can expect HD video &amp; HD audio in any zoom call. Screen sharing is also an important video conferencing tool that Zoom naturally comes with.</p>\n<p>A major positive side of Zoom as compared to Webex is that Zoom has created a single service, packed with various features including meetings, training, support, and SIP calling integration. What this means is that when you purchase a plan - you receive all of these features at once.</p>\n<p>The Zoom video webinar service is also readily available, as is video conferencing. Additionally, <strong>Zoom users can expect the ability to manage meetings, SSL security, video call recording, and third-party app integration.</strong></p>\n<p>Lastly, Zoom offers something called &#39;Breakout rooms&#39;. This feature enables the host(s) to split a single meeting into multiple breakout groups. This is done quickly and seamlessly and allows for more flexibility when managing meetings.</p>\n<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>HD video &amp; HD audio support</li>\n<li>Whiteboarding</li>\n<li>Screen sharing</li>\n<li>SSL Security</li>\n<li>Larger features are combined into one service</li>\n<li>Meeting management</li>\n<li>Video call recording</li>\n<li>Third-party app integration</li>\n<li>Breakout rooms</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Webex</h3>\n<p>The Cisco Webex platform <strong>comes with nearly the same features albeit with differences in key areas</strong>. As such, Webex offers file transfers and the ability to remove attendees from meeting rooms but doesn&#39;t come with HD audio.</p>\n<p>Now you might be thinking that HD audio is not that important but the reality is, this might lead to situations where participants can&#39;t hear each other properly. And in that regard, Zoom is the winner. But hold on, there&#39;s more to Webex than just that.</p>\n<p>The Cisco Webex web conferencing platform doesn&#39;t offer larger features in one service - contrary to Zoom. Unfortunately, you&#39;d have to purchase them as separate products meaning buying the Webex Meetings, Webex Support, and Webex Training.</p>\n<p>Webex is also equipped with screen sharing, whiteboarding, meeting management, and third-party app integration capabilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>HD video support</li>\n<li>Whiteboarding</li>\n<li>Screen sharing</li>\n<li>SSL security</li>\n<li>Meeting management</li>\n<li>Third-party app integration</li>\n<li>File transfers</li>\n<li>Ability to remove attendees</li>\n<li>Co-browsing</li>\n<li>Larger features are sold as separate products</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Who&#39;s Better?</h3>\n<p><strong>Gotta go with Zoom yet again</strong>. Zoom is jam-packed with features and although Webex is close behind, it hasn&#39;t yet reached Zoom&#39;s level. Combine this with the fact that Zoom is inherently cheaper than Webex and you&#39;ve got plenty of reasons to choose Zoom as of right now.</p>\n<p>This doesn&#39;t mean Webex is a bad choice, just that the price doesn&#39;t really justify what you get in the paid plans. Even so, Webex is more expensive for other reasons and it&#39;s those reasons that some companies may find more important than the ones listed here.</p>\n<h2>Security</h2>\n<p>Security in the video conferencing market can be defined in multiple ways; technically it is the sum of its parts. What I mean by this is that for a room conferencing tool to be secure, it needs to provide adequate protection against unauthorized access and hacking attempts, while simultaneously encrypting user data and requiring user authentication.</p>\n<p>Both Webex and Zoom do this very well which is a good sign; whichever one you pick, you&#39;ll be met with strong security measures. Let&#39;s analyze them both:</p>\n<h3>Zoom</h3>\n<p>The Zoom platform offers great security features that should in most cases prove to be enough. <strong>Zoom security features include two-factor authentication, data encryption (no end-to-end encryption yet, unfortunately), waiting rooms, an alert system to indicate when a participant is recording a call</strong>, and more.</p>\n<p>Although these features make Zoom meetings fairly protected, there are still concerns regarding Zoom&#39;s lack of, dedication let&#39;s say, towards improving security even further and fixing certain issues.</p>\n<p>These issues range from incompetent support personnel to &#39;Zoombombing&#39;. The latter refers to the &#39;practice&#39; of joining a call unauthorized and showing or playing inappropriate content. Keep in mind that Zoom was originally oriented towards businesses but slowly moved away from that and started turning Zoom into a broader video conferencing solution.</p>\n<p>Zoom meetings can be vulnerable solely because of the <strong>lack of advanced security features such as end-to-end encryption</strong>. Zoom has, however, managed to upgrade some of their security features including the ability to assign passwords to Zoom rooms.</p>\n<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two-factor authentication</li>\n<li>Data encryption</li>\n<li>Waiting rooms</li>\n<li>Call recording alert system</li>\n<li>Host controls for screen or file sharing</li>\n<li>Ability to place participants on hold</li>\n<li>Optional password protection or user verification for using Zoom rooms</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cisco Webex</h3>\n<p>In the Webex vs Zoom debate, Webex has historically been a more security and business-oriented video conferencing solution. Because of this, the focus has been on protecting the host and participants, as well as the entire business, from all forms of attack.</p>\n<p>Webex meetings are secure in a multitude of ways including <strong>end-to-end data encryption, granting or revoking access privileges to participants, two-factor authentication, password protection for conference rooms</strong>, and more.</p>\n<p>These are just some of the Webex features you can expect to keep your mind at ease regarding security and data protection.</p>\n<p>As such, medium and even large-scale businesses have opted to use Cisco Webex if they need the extra security for their employees.</p>\n<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two-factor authentication</li>\n<li>End-to-end data encryption</li>\n<li>Screen or file-sharing controls</li>\n<li>Ability to grant or revoke access to participants</li>\n<li>Password protection for meeting rooms</li>\n<li>Secure data centers</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Who&#39;s Better?</h3>\n<p>While Zoom offers fairly secure options for all your web conferencing needs, it, unfortunately, isn&#39;t enough to win this battle. As said before, Webex pricing isn&#39;t ideal considering what you get but as far as security is concerned - they&#39;re unparalleled.</p>\n<p>Considering Cisco&#39;s history of being solely business-oriented, the <strong>Zoom-Webex debate in regards to security goes in favor of Webex</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Third-Party App Integration</h2>\n<p>Some businesses may use these apps as webinar software which doesn&#39;t really require the usage of third-party apps, whilst others conduct their business on several and would like to integrate them for simplifying the communication process.</p>\n<p>A perfect example of this would be an IT company that uses Slack for in-house communication, Google Drive for sharing files, and Google Calendar for determining deadlines. For the best experience and additional hybrid platform preferences, these apps would need to be integrated with a video conferencing platform.</p>\n<p>Well, the good news is that, as far as the Zoom vs Cisco Webex battle is concerned, both platforms have exceptional software integration.</p>\n<h3>Zoom</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Calendar</li>\n<li>Google Drive</li>\n<li>Dropbox</li>\n<li>Microsoft OneDrive</li>\n<li>Skype</li>\n<li>Slack</li>\n<li>MailChimp</li>\n<li>Salesforce</li>\n<li>Eloqua</li>\n<li>Panapto</li>\n<li>Hipchat</li>\n<li>Workplace by Facebook</li>\n<li>Marketa</li>\n<li>Okta</li>\n<li>Microsoft Outlook</li>\n<li>ClickUp</li>\n<li>Appointlet</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cisco Webex</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Calendar</li>\n<li>Google Drive</li>\n<li>Microsoft OneDrive</li>\n<li>Slack</li>\n<li>Salesforce</li>\n<li>Github</li>\n<li>Asana</li>\n<li>Trello</li>\n<li>JIRA</li>\n<li>Sharepoint</li>\n<li>Microsoft Teams</li>\n<li>Box</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Who&#39;s Better?</h3>\n<p>If you&#39;re judging by raw numbers, then Zoom wins. <strong>Zoom offers integration with 17 apps</strong> with more to come and is pretty versatile in their choices. However, they aren&#39;t really focused on project management tools and as such, can add another layer of complexity to the work environment.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, you can expect to integrate with <strong>12 apps for your Cisco Webex meetings</strong>. Although the number of apps supported by Webex is lower, it seems much better acquainted for proper project management work.</p>\n<p>It doesn&#39;t support as many communication and organization apps as Zoom, but you&#39;ll have a much better time managing your projects and deadlines.</p>\n<p><strong>The margins in this comparison are very close yet I have to give it to Webex</strong>. Its app integration support is much more useful on a grander scale than Zoom&#39;s and can actually save your team (as well as yourself) plenty of time and effort as the apps can be used in conjunction with Webex.</p>\n<h3>Webinar Capabilities</h3>\n<p>Webinars are an informative and effective way of transferring various information and knowledge one might want to share with others. Webinars function the same way as seminars but in an online setting. The Webex comparison to Zoom regarding webinar features is just as important as everything else since it&#39;s part of the whole thing.</p>\n<h3>Zoom</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Live Q/A Sessions</li>\n<li>Zoom room for panelists (for practice)</li>\n<li>Live chat and polling during the webinar</li>\n<li>Screen sharing for panelists</li>\n<li>Attendees can be promoted to hosts</li>\n<li>Automation of marketing</li>\n<li>Zoom events support up to 3,000 participants</li>\n<li>Hosting capabilities allow hosting for up to 100,000 attendees</li>\n<li>Personalized quote for events numbering more than 10,000 attendees</li>\n<li>Simultaneous display of up to 720 HD video scenes</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cisco Webex</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Exceptional video quality (720p)</li>\n<li>Screen share for panelists</li>\n<li>Many unique background types (blurred, virtual, branded)</li>\n<li>Practice room for panelists</li>\n<li>Live messaging and polling during the webinar</li>\n<li>Personalized URL that is sent out after the event for promotional offers or additional materials</li>\n<li>Various useful Q/A tools</li>\n<li>Webex events support up to 3,000 participants</li>\n<li>Hosting capabilities allow hosting for up to 100,000 attendees</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Who&#39;s Better?</h3>\n<p><strong>Thanks to its advanced webinar features and solutions to known problems, Webex takes the win here</strong>. Don&#39;t misunderstand me in this case; Zoom does a perfectly good job of being a great webinar hosting solution but it trails slightly behind Webex.</p>\n<p>After all, that sweet, fast bandwidth and crisp video quality (considering everything) are what most webinar hosts want from such a platform.</p>\n<h2>Final Verdict</h2>\n<p>Both Webex and Zoom are incredible choices for all your video conferencing needs. It&#39;s very difficult to tell you which piece of software is better because they are both very complex and oriented towards different types of users. <strong>Zoom is more user-friendly and accessible to the Average Joe, but Webex seems to be more powerful at the time being with a more corporate approach.</strong></p>\n<p>Webex requires a specific type of business to use it in order to be fully effective in what it offers. It&#39;s also cheaper and better in terms of security and webinar capabilities.</p>\n<p>The truth is, it depends on what you&#39;re looking for. If you need an easy-to-use, powerful, and versatile video conferencing solution then the Zoom portal is for you. On the other hand, if you want something more secure, cheap, and generally focused on making businesses happy - Webex is the better choice.</p>\n<p><strong>Make sure to evaluate what your business needs before making a choice</strong>. And remember; if you encounter any issues along the way, you should contact Zoom support or use the Webex contact center for all your questions.</p>\n<h2>Zoom and Webex FAQs</h2>\n<h3>Do you need an account for Zoom and Webex?</h3>\n<p>No. Although you will be restricted to the most basic features on both platforms.</p>\n<h3>Are Webinars free?</h3>\n<p>Regarding Zoom, you&#39;ll need to purchase a webinar license in order to host one. Webex Events on the other hand does not require a specific license to host a webinar.</p>\n<h3>Should I use the Free Plans in the beginning?</h3>\n<p>It would be a good idea, yes. That way, you can test out the basic functionalities of both platforms and see how everything goes. Just remember that you won&#39;t have all the features and options unlocked in the free version.</p>\n"

      "content": "<p>When choosing to build your very first website, finding a suitable website builder or content management system (CMS) can be a struggle. After all, there are tons of different platforms you can use to build your website.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Two of the platforms you can use to build your website are Wix or WordPress. Before we get into our analysis of Wix vs.WordPress, we have to point out that comparing these platforms is like comparing apples to oranges. These platforms are great in their own right but as you&#39;ll see, they are vastly different as well.</p>\n<p>Building your first website will often come down to a few key factors. One of these factors depends on your level of comfortability with web design and development. Another crucial factor is the level of customization you will have in making any change you want to your website.</p>\n<p>As we&#39;ll demonstrate, Wix and WordPress are both great at one but not necessarily both factors.</p>\n<h2>Wix vs.WordPress - An Overview</h2>\n<p>Before we get started in our Wix vs.WordPress comparison, let&#39;s take a quick look at some of the key facts and points about each platform.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://serp.ly/wix/\">Wix:</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Was founded in 2006 in Israel.</li>\n<li>Was founded by Avishai Abrahami, Nadav Abrahami, and Giora Kaplan.</li>\n<li>Their head office is in Tel Aviv, Israel.</li>\n<li>Has 19 offices worldwide.</li>\n<li>Employs over 5,000 people across all their offices.</li>\n<li>Had an IPO in 2013 and is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange.</li>\n<li>Generated $1 billion in revenue in 2020.</li>\n<li>Has a user base of over 200 million as of 2020.</li>\n<li>Premium subscriptions are growing at a rate of 15% year over year.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong><a href=\"https://serp.ly/wordpress/\">WordPress:</a></strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Was founded in 2003.</li>\n<li>Was founded by Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little.</li>\n<li>Their head office is in San Francisco, USA.</li>\n<li>Its parent company is Automattic.</li>\n<li>The name WordPress was recommended by a friend of Mullenweg.</li>\n<li>65% of all websites that use a CMS are using WordPress as of 2021.</li>\n<li>41% of the top 10 million websites are run on WordPress.</li>\n<li>As of 2021, it&#39;s estimated that over 64 million websites are using WordPress.</li>\n<li>Generates over 400 million unique visitors each month to their website.</li>\n<li>Generates over 20 billion page views each month.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Ease of Use</h2>\n<p>A website builder&#39;s ease of use can be one of its biggest strengths. Not every website builder or CMS is easy to use or learn. You also have to remember that people have varying degrees of tech-savviness and may find some more challenging to use than others.</p>\n<p>But, when it comes to ease of use, we&#39;ll evaluate how easy it is for a person new to website building to learn Wix or WordPress if they had never used it before.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://serp.ly/wix/\">Wix</a></h3>\n<p>Hands down, between Wix and WordPress, Wix is a far easier website builder to use. Wix features a &quot;what you see is what you get&quot; (WYSIWYG) builder that makes the experience for new and experienced web users enjoyable.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p>With the WYSIWYG Wix editor, you&#39;re able to move blocks of images, copy, buttons, and more, around with a simple drag and drop. It&#39;s easy to edit and re-arrange these blocks in any order or hierarchy that you want and can be done in a very quick manner.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Most WYSIWYG editors are made with beginners or inexperienced web users in mind and Wix sites are no different. The target demographic here is clearly people that want to build a website but may feel discouraged because they lack any coding ability. WYSIWYG web builders help to overcome this problem.</p>\n<p>Simply put, if you&#39;ve never put together a website before and are hesitant to do so, Wix makes the process as seamless and easy to do so as possible.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://serp.ly/wordpress/\">WordPress</a></h3>\n<p>WordPress, on the other hand, is more geared towards people that are more technically proficient when it comes to using digital platforms. While it&#39;s nice to be able to see how your website will look in real-time using a WYSIWYG editor, WordPress does not provide that.</p>\n<p>Thus, if you want to be able to see the changes you&#39;ve made to your website, you can&#39;t do it in real-time and will always need to save your page draft and hit the preview or publish buttons to see it.</p>\n<p>On top of not being able to see your edits live, the WordPress editor is also much different from Wix&#39;s. You can&#39;t drag and drop blocks of content on your page and move them around with a few clicks. Users with coding experience will definitely have a leg up when using WordPress over people who don&#39;t.</p>\n<p>On top of coding experience, the WordPress experience can heavily rely on plugins and extensions. Installing these aren&#39;t always a breeze and users with more technical skills will really be able to get the most out of WordPress.</p>\n<p>On the whole, however, WordPress does require a certain level of technical know-how to operate and is not the easiest way to build a website, especially your first one.</p>\n<h3>The Victor: Wix</h3>\n<p>The ease of use Wix vs.WordPress battle easily belongs to Wix. Creating a Wix website is simply much easier than creating a WordPress website. No coding experience is required and making edits is easy to do and can be done in real-time.</p>\n<p>The primary factor here is that people of all technical levels from beginner to expert can create a website on Wix. The same, however, cannot be said for WordPress websites.</p>\n<h2>Customization and Design</h2>\n<p>We&#39;ve identified that Wix is a much easier platform to create your website on but, what about customizing and designing your website? Which one is easier?</p>\n<p>Being able to design and customize your website is an important factor because it will tell you how much freedom you have in how you want your website to look. To design and customize your website, you don&#39;t need any coding experience at all!</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://serp.ly/wix/\">Wix</a></h3>\n<p>Creating a website can actually be a quick process thanks to the Wix templates. These templates offer Wix users a customizable way to create their own website. They come loaded with text and graphics and using the Wix editor, you can insert your own images and overwrite the text in the template with your own copy.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Getting started with these Wix website templates is fast to do as well. Right after signing up with Wix, you&#39;ll then be prompted to select from over 900 different and free templates. Once you&#39;ve found the right one for you, you can start customizing your website.</p>\n<p>These templates are pre-coded, meaning you don&#39;t have to do anything to the code! They&#39;re also fully responsive which means these websites will be optimized for mobile and desktop devices.</p>\n<p>The Wix templates are truly beautiful however, the one limitation to editing your website in Wix is that you cannot customize every single feature. You only can customize the blocks that the template allows you to edit.</p>\n<p>We also have to warn you, however, that once you select your Wix template, you cannot change it. That&#39;s why it&#39;s important that you are absolutely sure you want to proceed with the template you have chosen. You can customize and edit your selected template as much as you want. But, if you realize a month later that the template you chose is not right for you, then you are simply out of luck!</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://serp.ly/wordpress/\">WordPress</a></h3>\n<p>While WordPress does require a bit of coding knowledge, the level of customization is virtually endless with a WordPress website.</p>\n<p>Like Wix, WordPress also offers pre-coded themes that you can download and use for your website. Many of these pre-coded ones are free WordPress themes, however, there are tons that you can purchase.</p>\n<p>If you don&#39;t like the selection of WordPress templates, you are free to find a template from a third-party website but it&#39;s likely you will have to pay for it. There are also Premium WordPress themes that you can purchase from WordPress directly. These themes can cost up to $300.</p>\n<p>Once you have chosen your WordPress template, you can begin customizing how you want to. These themes will have their own customization features and some can be more user-friendly. To supplement customizing your website, you can also install plugins that can often help to make the process easier.</p>\n<p>The one feature where Wix falls short, being unable to change your template after you have chosen one, is not applicable for WordPress. Users are free to select a different WordPress theme at any time. This is great if you encounter scalability issues and perhaps, your website has grown a lot faster than you anticipated.</p>\n<h3>The Victor: Tie</h3>\n<p>This one is too close to call so this Wix. vs WordPress battle of design and customization features ends in a draw. The comparison between these two platforms is really about tradeoffs.</p>\n<p>Customizing a Wix template is easy to do but you&#39;re really limited in what you can edit. You also cannot change templates so you&#39;re handcuffed to keep on with the template you have chosen forever.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, WordPress templates are highly customizable, so much so that you can virtually edit anything. There is a higher learning curve to installing your template and getting acclimated to the customization features. But, if you get to a point where you feel it might be too challenging, you&#39;re free to select a different template!</p>\n<p>The tradeoff is best represented by this graphic.</p>\n<p>Both platforms offer solid customization options through Wix or WordPress themes. The only question is what level of customization are you comfortable with? If you&#39;re new to website design and don&#39;t need to absolutely customize every single element of your website, then Wix is probably right for you.</p>\n<p>However, if you need to be able to edit everything on your website and like the flexibility of being able to change your theme at any moment, create a WordPress site instead.</p>\n<p>In any event, we&#39;re calling this a tie because it just really depends on what you&#39;re comfortable with!</p>\n<h2>Blogging</h2>\n<p>It&#39;s estimated that there are over <a href=\"https://hostingtribunal.com/blog/how-many-blogs/#gref\">600 million blogging websites</a> out there on the world wide web today. So, it&#39;s understandable then that people would turn to Wix or WordPress to create their own blog.</p>\n<p>For bloggers, they&#39;re usually looking for a quick and easy way to create their content in. The website builder must be intuitive and user-friendly. Fortunately, both Wix and WordPress have terrific blogging features and both provide an optimal blogging experience.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://serp.ly/wix/\">Wix</a></h3>\n<p>As you might have guessed, Wix&#39;s platform is great for beginner bloggers. Their WYSIWYG editor allows you to quickly add in your content and see how your blog will look as you edit it.</p>\n<p>You can also easily add images or any other media such as gifs to your blog by using the drag-and-drop feature. When it comes to giving your blog a category, Wix supports the creation of categories and tags so that your blogs will be indexed appropriately on your Wix website.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p>There are some downsides to using Wix as your main blogging platform. Unfortunately, if you want to add a table, you&#39;ll need to know how to code that since it is not an addable content block. You would also be out of luck if you wanted to backdate certain blog posts.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://serp.ly/wordpress/\">WordPress</a></h3>\n<p>What some people may not realize is that WordPress actually has its roots in the blogging world. It first started out as a blogging-focused platform and over time, it just grew out of that niche and into a full-on website builder.</p>\n<p>With the WordPress software, you can use the Gutenberg block editor or any other block-based editor to help create your blogs. These editors enable users to create a layout where they can add blocks of content. While it&#39;s not as intuitive as Wix&#39;s editor, WordPress&#39; blogging editor is more advanced and offers more features.</p>\n<p>For example, it comes with its own commenting section, something that Wix does not offer yet. Commenting can be a crucial element on any blog as it lets a blogger&#39;s audience engage with the blogger and the blog post itself.</p>\n<p>WordPress also gives bloggers the option to make certain blogs private so that you can see them but your audience can&#39;t. Bloggers might use this function if they publish a blog but then choose to later put it on private because perhaps, they released it too early or they want to wait indefinitely to post it. Keeping the blog private prevents them from deleting the blog and saving the time from re-creating it at a later date.</p>\n<p>When the blogger is ready to take that private blog to a public one, they also have the choice to backdate this blog with WordPress.</p>\n<h3>The Victor: WordPress</h3>\n<p>When we compare Wix vs.WordPress&#39; blogging capabilities, it&#39;s clear to us that WordPress wins this battle. While Wix offers simplicity in their blog creation, WordPress just offers that and much more functionality with theirs.</p>\n<p>We especially like that WordPress has its own native commenting section as engagement with a blogger&#39;s audience is a key metric of success. Having the freedom to set some blogs on private and then backdate them once they do go live are two other great features for bloggers to have.</p>\n<p>WordPress&#39; powerful blogging tools make it a much better choice over Wix when it comes to the full spectrum of blogging features.</p>\n<h2>Applications and Plugins</h2>\n<p>Another interesting feature in the Wix vs.WordPress debate is the use of apps and plugins to enhance a website. Since Wix and WordPress are different types of website builders, it should come as no surprise that these website enhancements are called different things for each platform.</p>\n<p>Wix calls these add-ons &quot;apps&quot; whereas WordPress calls them &quot;plugins.&quot; Either way, the goal of both is the same: to add more features to your website and to make the website creation process smoother.</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s find out how these apps and plugins do so for Wix and WordPress, respectively.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://serp.ly/wix/\">Wix</a></h3>\n<p>Wix understands their target market and that most of the people that use their service are likely going to be a beginner or someone with little web design experience.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, users will get access to over 200 Wix apps that you can peruse and decide which one you want to add to your Wix site.</p>\n<p>These apps are quite broad in what they offer users from email marketing to a commenting section to adding Google Ads and so on.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Depending on the Wix apps that you choose to add to your website, some of them will be free while others will require some form of payment.</p>\n<p>Before you get started building your website, it&#39;s probably a good idea to browse the Wix app market and see which apps you want to add to your site. Most of these apps are created by third-party developers while Wix offers a few of their own apps in this app store.</p>\n<p>What&#39;s important to note is that every app in the Wix app store is and has been reviewed and approved by Wix. This is to ensure that the apps being offered are legitimate and meet the standards Wix has set out.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://serp.ly/wordpress/\">WordPress</a></h3>\n<p>Unlike Wix where each third-party application is vetted, the same cannot be said for WordPress plugins. That&#39;s because WordPress is an open-source platform that gives any developer the right to create their own WordPress plugin.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Developers can create plugins that are both free and paid and once they are ready, anyone can choose to download them. Since anyone can add a plugin at any time, there are over 50,000 WordPress plugins available to download!</p>\n<p>While 50,000 plugins seem like a lot to sift through to find what you&#39;re looking for, many of the more popular plugins are rated favorably. This is often a good way to judge whether a plugin has been downloaded by other users and what their thoughts on it are.</p>\n<p>Despite having an enormous library of plugins, some plugins can be more difficult than others to install. To install these plugins, you&#39;ll obviously need to have a version of WordPress installed. Some common installation issues with plugins are that they can be challenging to install and some can even conflict with other already installed plugins.</p>\n<h3>The Victor: WordPress</h3>\n<p>In this battle between Wix vs.WordPress of the best add-on features, it&#39;s once again about the tradeoffs. For Wix, it&#39;s quality over quantity, and for WordPress, it&#39;s strength in numbers. Both approaches are fine but we&#39;re choosing WordPress as the winner.</p>\n<p>The Wix app store is great because it provides over 200 different apps to help enhance your Wix website. As we mentioned already, these apps have been reviewed and approved by Wix so that there are no surprises in their app store. However, this severely limits what Wix users can find on the app store simply because there isn&#39;t enough choice. To further compound the issue, Wix isn&#39;t an open-source platform like WordPress and users cannot simply get someone to design and develop their app and upload it to the Wix store.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, WordPress is an open-source platform and because of this, anyone can create their own plugin. We prefer having this versatility despite the fact that finding the right plugin for you can be a time-consuming task.</p>\n<p>With over 50,000 plugins available, we prefer the variety WordPress plugins have to offer.</p>\n<h2>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h2>\n<p>One of the most important aspects of creating your first website is getting people to come to it! Search engine optimization (SEO) is the foundational way for users to leverage to try and get visitors to their page.</p>\n<p>Both Wix and WordPress do offer some SEO-rich features, most of the best ways to leverage SEO tools is by installing apps and plugins.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://serp.ly/wix/\">Wix</a></h3>\n<p>With Wix, you can accomplish very basic SEO such as setting your header tags, adding alt tags to images, and creating meta descriptions. However, this is pretty much the extent of Wix&#39;s native SEO features.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Because of Wix&#39;s SEO limitations, users turn to the Wix app market to install their SEO tools. A few of the more popular SEO apps are Wix SEO Wiz and Site Booster. Both apps are easy to use and will walk you through some SEO basics. They&#39;re also helpful to have when you&#39;re trying to rank higher in search results and getting your site added to online directories.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://serp.ly/wordpress/\">WordPress</a></h3>\n<p>Like Wix, WordPress also leans heavily on plugins to do the heavy SEO lifting. Without plugins, WordPress SEO features are fairly similar to Wix. You can set H1-6 tags, add alt and metadata, and meta descriptions. One SEO feature you have more control over in WordPress is that you can alter the URL to whatever you prefer.</p>\n<p>To get the full SEO benefit, you must use a plugin. Arguably one of the best plugins you can download in WordPress is Yoast SEO. In fact, it&#39;s so good that we recommend you install it right after you install WordPress.</p>\n<p>Yoast SEO is used in millions of WordPress websites and it comes with free and paid services. If you&#39;re just looking for basic SEO features, you&#39;ll be fine with the free version. However, if you want to get the most out of this plugin, Yoast SEO premium will cost you about $70.</p>\n<p>While Yoast SEO is the de facto king of WordPress SEO plugins, there are other free plugins you can try that offer good SEO features.</p>\n<h3>The Victor: WordPress</h3>\n<p>The SEO apps that are offered in the Wix app store are good but not great. There&#39;s simply just a limited selection of SEO tools here. Fortunately, the SEO tools that they do have in the Wix store are simple and get the job done. They aren&#39;t overly complicated to navigate through and do a good job of helping new users learn the basics of SEO.</p>\n<p>There are millions of WordPress sites that use the Yoast SEO plugin and we have to say, that this plugin alone gives WordPress the win. This SEO plugin comes packed with excellent SEO features that help you optimize your website and help it to get discovered by search engines.</p>\n<p>Users can take the basic SEO features from this plugin in the free version or pay to upgrade for the full features. Both options are good depending on what your SEO goals are.</p>\n<p>This plugin is absolutely essential for any WordPress website building!</p>\n<h2>Ecommerce</h2>\n<p>The past few years have seen a sharp increase in the number of eCommerce websites. Ecommerce is essentially where people sell their products on their website. If you use a dedicated eCommerce platform like Shopify, you can have a seamless and tailored experience towards managing your inventory, sales, marketing, and website efforts on that platform.</p>\n<p>While neither Wix nor WordPress is specifically an eCommerce platform, they both can accommodate e-commerce on their respective platforms.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://serp.ly/wix/\">Wix</a></h3>\n<p>While Wix is not just an eCommerce platform, it does offer its own eCommerce paid plan. Wix users that want to use their Wix site for eCommerce need to purchase this plan. Ecommerce features are not available as part of Wix&#39;s free plans.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p>If you do purchase a Wix eCommerce plan, you&#39;ll actually get plenty of great value for what you pay for. For instance, you&#39;ll obviously be able to sell your products on your Wix page but you can also accept and process payments using Wix Payments or a third-party payment gateway app like PayPal.</p>\n<p>Be sure that you&#39;re okay with the transaction terms associated with Wix Payments. As of now, they charge 2.9% + $0.30 for every transaction in the United States.</p>\n<p>There are also a few different eCommerce-specific apps in the Wix app market. These apps can help you sell and upsell your products and promote and market your store.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://serp.ly/wordpress/\">WordPress</a></h3>\n<p>WordPress also features an eCommerce pricing plan and with it, users can leverage the largest and most popular eCommerce platform in the world, WooCommerce.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p>WooCommerce is an eCommerce plugin that you have to download in order to use it. But, once you do download it, you can do virtually anything eCommerce-related with it. WooCommerce also offers WooCommerce Payments, which is a free feature of this plugin, although users are still on the hook for any transaction fees. With WooCommerce, you&#39;ll also have to pay for a custom domain and web hosting.</p>\n<p>Fees aside, the WooCommerce plugin allows users to build the online store that they want and all this can be done from WordPress.</p>\n<p>Of course, WordPress users aren&#39;t obligated to use the WooCommerce plugin. With WordPress&#39; vast library of plugins, there are tons of other eCommerce plugins that they can use. These plugins are excellent at helping users sell their products and promote their online store.</p>\n<h3>The Victor: WordPress</h3>\n<p>The winner of this Wix vs.WordPress eCommerce battle is...WordPress. When you have the largest and most popular eCommerce platform available to you as a downloadable plugin, it&#39;s hard to look any other way. WooCommerce is an eCommerce giant and they do everything right to help users make a sale and process payments.</p>\n<p>Wix&#39;s eCommerce offering is no slouch either. They offer reasonably fair eCommerce pricing plans that beginner users can choose for creating their eCommerce website on Wix. However, in terms of scalability and handling growth, WooCommerce is the best solution to handle this and it&#39;s why we&#39;re going with WordPress again.</p>\n<h2>Pricing</h2>\n<p>Pricing can often be a determining factor when it comes to which website builder or content management system (CMS) you want to build your website on. If you&#39;re not particularly set on both Wix&#39;s or WordPress&#39;s features, your final decision might just rest on pricing and what your budget may be.</p>\n<p>Below, you will find the various pricing plans for both Wix and WordPress.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://serp.ly/wix/\">Wix</a></h3>\n<p>Currently, Wix offers two different sets of pricing plans. The first is a set of pricing plans for the Wix Website Plans. There are four different plans under this &#39;category&#39; and they are VIP, Unlimited, Combo, and Connect Domain.</p>\n<p>Each plan varies in features and functionality and ranges in prices. The prices are expressed on a per month basis.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p>For users seeking to leverage more business-related features from Wix, Wix also offers Business &amp; Ecommerce Plans. These plans include Business VIP, Business Unlimited, and Business Basic.</p>\n<p>These Wix websites come with the ability for your site to accept online payments and more. Once again, the prices of these plans are reflected on a per month basis.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://serp.ly/wordpress/\">WordPress</a></h3>\n<p>WordPress keeps it relatively simple with its pricing plans. They only offer four plans but each plan is distinct for a specific purpose. The plans that WordPress offers are Personal, Premium, Business, and E-commerce.</p>\n<p>WordPress offers its plans on a monthly or annual payment schedule. For those looking to pay monthly, here are the plans and their prices:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p>For those looking for a longer-term commitment, here is the WordPress pricing on an annual basis:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<h3>The Victor: WordPress</h3>\n<p>When you have to start flipping through different tabs to compare the features and prices of plans, that&#39;s probably too much information to consume. Wix&#39;s prices and plans are great but a lack of simplicity makes WordPress the winner of this battle round.</p>\n<p>We enjoy the fact that WordPress neatly displays its four plans and shows exactly what you&#39;re going to get, all on one page. Their prices are also very fair and reasonable.</p>\n<h2>What are the Pros and Cons of Wix?</h2>\n<p>Wix has established itself as an intuitive and easy-to-use website builder. Despite these attractive features, they also feature some cons as well. Here are the best pros and cons of building a Wix site.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdsbest/mdsbest.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/placeholder.jpg\"></p>\n<p><strong>Wix Pros</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is great for people with little web design experience to build a website quickly.</li>\n<li>No coding experience is required to build a website.</li>\n<li>Little to no technical experience is needed to install apps or troubleshooting app installations.</li>\n<li>Clean and intuitive user interface.</li>\n<li>All the apps in the app store are vetted and verified by the Wix team.</li>\n<li>A WYSIWYG editor lets users edit and see how their Wix site will look in real-time.</li>\n<li>Drag-and-drop block builder makes it easy for users to add in their content.</li>\n<li>Has basic SEO features.</li>\n<li>Can create a dedicated ecommerce website but only with a specific Wix ecommerce plan.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Wix Cons</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wix websites tend to be slower to load which can affect SEO and user experience.</li>\n<li>Unable to switch themes after selecting one.</li>\n<li>Can&#39;t customize every single aspect of your website.</li>\n<li>You&#39;re limited to only the apps available in the Wix app store.</li>\n<li>Is not open-source and can&#39;t download third-party apps that aren&#39;t in the Wix app store.</li>\n<li>More expensive than WordPress&#39; pricing plans.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What are the Pros and Cons of WordPress?</h2>\n<p>Like Wix, there are many pros and cons to building a WordPress website. Here are the most notable ones.</p>\n<p><strong>WordPress Pros</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is free to install WordPress.</li>\n<li>Is open-source which allows anyone to develop and make available their own plugins or themes.</li>\n<li>Has much more online resources and support since over 40% of all websites are run on WordPress.</li>\n<li>You have total control over your website in that you can customize every single aspect.</li>\n<li>Can change themes at a moment&#39;s notice.</li>\n<li>WordPress CMS is the best way to create pages, manage your content, and promote your website.</li>\n<li>Pricing plans are very fair and affordable.</li>\n<li>Excellent ecommerce integration with the WooCommerce plugin.</li>\n<li>A never-ending library of helpful plugins to add value to your website.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>WordPress Cons</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Has a much steeper learning curve for beginner web designers.</li>\n<li>Need some level of technical experience to troubleshoot any issues.</li>\n<li>The platform is not as user-friendly as Wix&#39;s.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Wix vs.WordPress: And the Winner is...</h2>\n<p>While both <a href=\"https://serp.ly/wix/\">Wix</a> and <a href=\"https://serp.ly/wordpress/\">WordPress</a> have strong features, WordPress is the winner of our Wix vs.WordPress overall battle.</p>\n<p>While WordPress does have some issues, most notably that it isn&#39;t the right platform for complete beginners when it comes to creating a website. Despite this, it&#39;s simply too much of a powerful platform to not want to learn.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s the best content management system out there and the fact that any part of your website can be customized is what it comes down to. Wix makes it easy to edit and customize your website, something WordPress struggles with, but you&#39;re unable to customize every aspect of your website with Wix.</p>\n<p>The last factor is the open-source vs.non-open-source. WordPress&#39; open-source platform allows any user to create a plugin and to that, over 50,000 plugins have been created! Comparing Wix and the meager 200+ apps they have in their arsenal, it&#39;s safe to say that users will eventually find what they&#39;re looking for with WordPress&#39; plugin library. If they don&#39;t, they can simply just create one themselves or get someone else to create it!</p>\n"
